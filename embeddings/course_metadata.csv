base64-encoding,0,3b33d7af-121e-4cc2-86d5-c943a6fde07d,base64-encoding.md,"# Base 64 Encoding

Base64 is a method to convert binary data into ASCII text. It's essential when you need to transmit binary data through text-only channels or embed binary content in text formats. Watch this quick explanation of how Base64 works (3 min):

[![What is Base64? (3 min)](https://i. ytimg. com/vi_webp/8qkxeZmKmOY/sddefault. webp)](https://youtu. be/8qkxeZmKmOY)

Here's how it works:

- It takes 3 bytes (24 bits) and converts them into 4 ASCII characters
-. . . using 64 characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, + and / (padding with `=` to make the length a multiple of 4)
- There's a URL-safe variant of Base64 that replaces + and / with - and \_ to avoid issues in URLs
- Base64 adds ~33% overhead (since every 3 bytes becomes 4 characters)

Common Python operations with Base64:

```python
import base64

# Basic encoding/decoding
text = ""Hello, World!""
# Convert text to base64
encoded = base64. b64encode(text. encode()). decode()  # SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==
# Convert base64 back to text
decoded = base64. b64decode(encoded). decode()        # Hello, World!
# Convert to URL-safe base64
url_safe = base64. urlsafe_b64encode(text. encode()). decode()  # SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==

# Working with binary files (e. g. , images)
with open('image. png', 'rb') as f:
    binary_data = f. read()
    image_b64 = base64. b64encode(binary_data). decode()

# Data URI example (embed images in HTML/CSS)
data_uri = f""data:image/png;base64,{image_b64}""
```

Data URIs allow embedding binary data directly in HTML/CSS. This reduces the number of HTTP requests and also works offline. But it increases the file size. For example, here's an SVG image embedded as a data URI:

```html
<img
  src=""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAzMiAzMiI+PGNpcmNsZSBjeD0iMTYiIGN5PSIxNiIgcj0iMTUiIGZpbGw9IiMyNTYzZWIiLz48cGF0aCBmaWxsPSIjZmZmIiBkPSJtMTYgNyAyIDcgNyAyLTcgMi0yIDctMi03LTctMiA3LTJaIi8+PC9zdmc+""
/>
```

Base64 is used in many places:

- JSON: Encoding binary data in JSON payloads
- Email: MIME attachments encoding
- Auth: HTTP Basic Authentication headers
- JWT: Encoding tokens in web authentication
- SSL/TLS: PEM certificate format
- SAML: Encoding assertions in SSO
- Git: Encoding binary files in patches

Tools for working with Base64:

convert-html-to-markdown,0,790e24ce-43a4-416b-b748-4f645f4c4e1a,convert-html-to-markdown.md,"## Converting HTML to Markdown

When working with web content, converting HTML files to plain text or Markdown is a common requirement for content extraction, analysis, and preservation. For example:

- **Content analysis**: Extract clean text from HTML for natural language processing
- **Data mining**: Strip formatting to focus on the actual content
- **Offline reading**: Convert web pages to readable formats for e-readers or offline consumption
- **Content migration**: Move content between different CMS platforms
- **SEO analysis**: Extract headings, content structure, and text for optimization
- **Archive creation**: Store web content in more compact, preservation-friendly formats
- **Accessibility**: Convert content to formats that work better with screen readers

This tutorial covers both converting existing HTML files and combining web crawling with HTML-to-text conversion in a single workflow -- all using the command line. ### defuddle-cli

[defuddle-cli](https://github. com/defuddle/defuddle) specializes in HTML - Markdown conversion. It's a bit slow and not very customizable but produces clean Markdown that preserves structure, links, and basic formatting. Best for content where preserving the document structure is important. ```bash
find. -name '*. html' -exec npx --package defuddle-cli -y defuddle parse {} --md -o {}. md \;
```

- `find. -name '*. html'`: Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories
- `-exec. . . \;`: Executes the following command for each file found
- `npx --package defuddle-cli -y`: Installs and runs defuddle-cli without prompting
- `defuddle parse {} --md`: Parses the HTML file (represented by `{}`) and converts to markdown
- `-o {}. md`: Outputs to a file with the original name plus. md extension

### Pandoc

[Pandoc](https://pandoc. org/) is a bit slow and highly customizable, preserving almost all formatting elements, leading to verbose markdown. Best for academic or documentation conversion where precision matters. Pandoc can convert from many other formats (such as Word, PDF, LaTeX, etc. ) to Markdown and vice versa, making it one of most popular and versatele document convertors. [![How to Convert a Word Document to Markdown for Free using Pandoc (12 min)](https://i. ytimg. com/vi/HPSK7q13-40/sddefault. jpg)](https://youtu. be/HPSK7q13-40)

```bash
find. -name '*. html' -exec pandoc -f html -t markdown_strict -o {}. md {} \;
```

- `find. -name '*. html'`: Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories
- `-exec. . . \;`: Executes the following command for each file found
- `pandoc`: The Swiss Army knife of document conversion
- `-f html -t markdown_strict`: Convert from HTML format to strict markdown
- `-o {}. md {}`: Output to a markdown file, with the input file as the last argument

### Lynx

[Lynx](https://lynx. invisible-island. net/) is fast and generates text (not Markdown) with minimal formatting. Lynx renders the HTML as it would appear in a text browser, preserving basic structure but losing complex formatting. Best for quick content extraction or when processing large numbers of files. ```bash
find. -type f -name '*. html' -exec sh -c 'for f; do lynx -dump -nolist ""$f"" > ""${f%. html}. txt""; done' _ {} +
```

- `find. -type f -name '*.",https://tds.s-anand.net/#/convert-html-to-markdown
convert-html-to-markdown,1,2a1f28ac-1582-4762-aeb2-197bb936785c,convert-html-to-markdown.md,"html'`: Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories
- `-exec sh -c '. . . ' _ {} +`: Executes a shell command with batched files for efficiency
- `for f; do. . . done`: Loops through each file in the batch
- `lynx -dump -nolist ""$f""`: Uses the lynx text browser to render HTML as plain text
  - `-dump`: Output the rendered page to stdout
  - `-nolist`: Don't include the list of links at the end
- `> ""${f%. html}. txt""`: Save output to a. txt file with the same base name

### w3m

[w3m](https://w3m. sourceforge. net/) is very slow processing with minimal formatting. w3m tends to be more thorough in its rendering than lynx but takes considerably longer. It supports basic JavaScript processing, making it better at handling modern websites with dynamic content. Best for cases where you need slightly better rendering than lynx, particularly for complex layouts and tables, and when some JavaScript processing is beneficial. ```bash
find. -type f -name '*. html' \
  -exec sh -c 'for f; do \
      w3m -dump -T text/html -cols 80 -no-graph ""$f"" > ""${f%. html}. md""; \
    done' _ {} +
```

- `find. -type f -name '*. html'`: Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories
- `-exec sh -c '. . . ' _ {} +`: Executes a shell command with batched files for efficiency
- `for f; do. . . done`: Loops through each file in the batch
- `w3m -dump -T text/html -cols 80 -no-graph ""$f""`: Uses the w3m text browser to render HTML
  - `-dump`: Output the rendered page to stdout
  - `-T text/html`: Specify input format as HTML
  - `-cols 80`: Set output width to 80 columns
  - `-no-graph`: Don't show graphic characters for tables and frames
- `> ""${f%. html}. md""`: Save output to a. md file with the same base name

### Comparison

| Approach     | Speed     | Format Quality | Preservation                       | Best For                        |
| ------------ | --------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| defuddle-cli | Slow      | High           | Good structure and links           | Content migration, publishing   |
| pandoc       | Slow      | Very High      | Almost everything                  | Academic papers, documentation  |
| lynx         | Fast      | Low            | Basic structure only               | Quick extraction, large batches |
| w3m          | Very Slow | Medium-Low     | Basic structure with better tables | Improved readability over lynx  |

### Optimize Batch Processing

1. **Process in parallel**: Use GNU Parallel for multi-core processing:

   ```bash
   find. -name ""*. html"" | parallel ""pandoc -f html -t markdown_strict -o {}. md {}""
   ```

2. **Filter files before processing**:

   ```bash
   find. -name ""*. html"" -type f -size -1M -exec pandoc -f html -t markdown {} -o {}. md \;
   ```

3. **Customize output format** with additional parameters:

   ```bash
   # For pandoc, preserve line breaks but simplify other formatting
   find. -name ""*. html"" -exec pandoc -f html -t markdown --wrap=preserve --atx-headers {} -o {}. md \;
   ```

4. **Handle errors gracefully**:

   ```bash
   find. -name ""*.",https://tds.s-anand.net/#/convert-html-to-markdown
convert-html-to-markdown,2,0c93b1d3-4df8-4d02-8a5f-12bd52dd9347,convert-html-to-markdown.md,"html"" -exec sh -c 'for f; do pandoc -f html -t markdown ""$f"" -o ""${f%. html}. md"" 2>/dev/null || echo ""Failed: $f"" >> conversion_errors. log; done' _ {} +
   ```

### Choosing the Right Tool

- **Need speed with minimal formatting?** Use the lynx approach
- **Need precise, complete conversion?** Use pandoc
- **Need a balance of structure and cleanliness?** Try defuddle-cli
- **Working with complex tables?** w3m might render them better

Remember that the best approach depends on your specific use case, volume of files, and how you intend to use the converted text. ### Combined Crawling and Conversion

Sometimes you need to both crawl a website and convert its content to markdown or text in a single workflow, like [Crawl4AI](#crawl4ai) or [markdown-crawler](#markdown-crawler). 1. **For research/data collection**: Use a specialized crawler (like Crawl4AI) with post-processing conversion
2. **For simple website archiving**: Markdown-crawler provides a convenient all-in-one solution
3. **For high-quality conversion**: Use wget/wget2 for crawling followed by pandoc for conversion
4. **For maximum speed**: Combine wget with lynx in a pipeline

### Crawl4AI

[Crawl4AI](https://github. com/crawl4ai/crawl4ai) is designed for single-page extraction with high-quality content processing. Crawl4AI is optimized for AI training data extraction, focusing on clean, structured content rather than complete site preservation. It excels at removing boilerplate content and preserving the main article text. ```bash
uv venv
source. venv/bin/activate. fish
uv pip install crawl4ai
crawl4ai-setup
```

- `uv venv`: Creates a Python virtual environment using uv (a faster alternative to virtualenv)
- `source. venv/bin/activate. fish`: Activates the virtual environment (fish shell syntax)
- `uv pip install crawl4ai`: Installs the crawl4ai package
- `crawl4ai-setup`: Initializes crawl4ai's required dependencies

### markdown-crawler

[markdown-crawler](https://pypi. org/project/markdown-crawler/) combines web crawling with markdown conversion in one tool. It's efficient for bulk processing but tends to produce lower-quality markdown conversion compared to specialized converters like pandoc or defuddle. Best for projects where quantity and integration are more important than perfect formatting. ```bash
uv venv
source. venv/bin/activate. fish
uv pip install markdown-crawler
markdown-crawler -t 5 -d 3 -b. /markdown https://study. iitm. ac. in/ds/
```

- `uv venv` and activation: Same as above
- `uv pip install markdown-crawler`: Installs the markdown-crawler package
- `markdown-crawler`: Runs the crawler with these options:
  - `-t 5`: Sets 5 threads for parallel crawling
  - `-d 3`: Limits crawl depth to 3 levels
  - `-b. /markdown`: Sets the base output directory
  - Final argument is the starting URL.",https://tds.s-anand.net/#/convert-html-to-markdown

Use Cases:

- **LLM training and fine-tuning**: Create clean text data from PDFs for AI model training
- **Knowledge base creation**: Transform PDFs into searchable, editable markdown documents
- **Content repurposing**: Convert academic papers and reports for web publication
- **Data extraction**: Pull structured content from PDF documents for analysis
- **Accessibility**: Convert PDFs to more accessible formats for screen readers
- **Citation and reference management**: Extract bibliographic information from academic papers
- **Documentation conversion**: Transform technical PDFs into maintainable documentation

### PyMuPDF4LLM

[PyMuPDF4LLM](https://pymupdf. readthedocs. io/en/latest/pymupdf4llm/) is a specialized component of the PyMuPDF library that generates Markdown specifically formatted for Large Language Models. It produces high-quality markdown with good preservation of document structure. It's specifically optimized for producing text that works well with LLMs, removing irrelevant formatting while preserving semantic structure. Requires PyTorch, which adds dependencies but enables more advanced processing capabilities. PyMuPDF4LLM uses [MuPDF](https://mupdf. com/) as its PDF parsing engine. [PyMuPDF](https://pymupdf. readthedocs. io/) is emerging as a strong default for PDF text extraction due to its accuracy and performance in handling complex PDF structures. ```bash
PYTHONUTF8=1 uv run --with pymupdf4llm python -c 'import pymupdf4llm; h = open(""pymupdf4llm. md"", ""w""); h. write(pymupdf4llm. to_markdown(""$FILE. pdf""))'
```

- `PYTHONUTF8=1`: Forces Python to use UTF-8 encoding regardless of system locale
- `uv run --with pymupdf4llm`: Uses uv package manager to run Python with the pymupdf4llm package
- `python -c '. . . '`: Executes Python code directly from the command line
- `import pymupdf4llm`: Imports the PDF-to-Markdown module
- `h = open(""pymupdf4llm. md"", ""w"")`: Creates a file to write the markdown output
- `h. write(pymupdf4llm. to_markdown(""$FILE. pdf""))`: Converts the PDF to markdown and writes to file

## Markitdown

[![Microsoft MarkItDown - Convert Files and Office Documents to Markdown - Install Locally (9 min)](https://i. ytimg. com/vi/v65Oyddfxeg/sddefault. jpg)](https://youtu. be/v65Oyddfxeg)

[Markitdown](https://github. com/microsoft/markitdown) is Microsoft's tool for converting various document formats to Markdown, including PDFs, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, and ZIP files. It's a versatile multi-format converter that handles PDFs via PDFMiner, DOCX via Mammoth, XLSX via Pandas, and PPTX via Python-PPTX. Good for batch processing of mixed document types. The quality of PDF conversion is generally good but may struggle with complex layouts or heavily formatted documents. ```bash
PYTHONUTF8=1 uvx markitdown $FILE. pdf > markitdown. md
```

- `PYTHONUTF8=1`: Forces Python to use UTF-8 encoding
- `uvx markitdown`: Runs the markitdown tool via the uv package manager
- `$FILE. pdf`: The input PDF file
- `> markitdown. md`: Redirects output to a markdown file

### Unstructured

[Unstructured](https://unstructured. io/) is rapidly becoming the de facto library for parsing over 40 different file types. It is excellent for extracting text and tables from diverse document formats. Particularly useful for generating clean content to pass to LLMs. Strong community support and actively maintained.",https://tds.s-anand.net/#/convert-pdfs-to-markdown
convert-pdfs-to-markdown,1,c9811fdf-854a-4be1-b0e4-62e0bc2f668d,convert-pdfs-to-markdown.md,"## GROBID

If you specifically need to parse references from text-native PDFs or reliably OCR'ed ones, [GROBID](https://github. com/kermitt2/grobid) remains the de facto choice. It excels at extracting structured bibliographic information with high accuracy. ```bash
# Start GROBID service
docker run -t --rm -p 8070:8070 lfoppiano/grobid:0. 7. 2

# Process PDF with curl
curl -X POST -F ""input=@paper. pdf"" localhost:8070/api/processFulltextDocument > references. tei. xml
```

### Mistral OCR API

[Mistral OCR](https://mistral. ai/products/ocr/) offers an end-to-end cloud API that preserves both text and layout, making it easier to isolate specific sections like References. It shows the most promise currently, though it requires post-processing. ## Azure Document Intelligence API

For enterprise users already in the Microsoft ecosystem, [Azure Document Intelligence](https://azure. microsoft. com/en-us/products/ai-services/document-intelligence) provides excellent raw OCR with enterprise SLAs. May require custom model training or post-processing to match GROBID's reference extraction capabilities. ### Other libraries

[Docling](https://github. com/DS4SD/docling) is IBM's document understanding library that supports PDF conversion. It can be challenging to install, particularly on Windows and some Linux distributions. Offers advanced document understanding capabilities beyond simple text extraction. [MegaParse](https://github. com/QuivrHQ/MegaParse) takes a comprehensive approach using LibreOffice, Pandoc, Tesseract OCR, and other tools. It has Robust handling of different document types but requires an OpenAI API key for some features. Good for complex documents but has significant dependencies. ## Comparison of PDF-to-Markdown Tools

- **Handling complex layouts?** Consider commercial OCR like Mistral or Azure Document Intelligence

The optimal approach depends on your specific requirements regarding accuracy, structure preservation, and the intended use of the extracted content. ## Tips for Optimal PDF Conversion

1. **Pre-process PDFs** when possible:

   ```bash
   # Optimize a PDF for text extraction first
   ocrmypdf --optimize 3 --skip-text input. pdf optimized. pdf
   ```

2. **Try multiple tools** on the same document to compare results:

3. **Handle scanned PDFs** appropriately:

   ```bash
   # For scanned documents, run OCR first
   ocrmypdf --force-ocr input. pdf ocr_ready. pdf
   PYTHONUTF8=1 uvx markitdown ocr_ready. pdf > markitdown. md
   ```

4. **Consider post-processing** for better results:

   ```bash
   # Simple post-processing example
   sed -i 's/\([A-Z]\)\. /\1\. \n/g' output. md  # Add line breaks after sentences
   ```.",https://tds.s-anand.net/#/convert-pdfs-to-markdown

cors,0,dcada89b-d57f-4d2d-9298-c8594094b77d,cors.md,"## CORS: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security mechanism that controls how web browsers handle requests between different origins (domains, protocols, or ports). Data scientists need CORS for APIs serving data or analysis to a browser on a different domain. Watch this practical explanation of CORS (3 min):

[![CORS in 100 Seconds](https://i. ytimg. com/vi_webp/4KHiSt0oLJ0/sddefault. webp)](https://youtu. be/4KHiSt0oLJ0)

Key CORS concepts:

- **Same-Origin Policy**: Browsers block requests between different origins by default
- **CORS Headers**: Server responses must include specific headers to allow cross-origin requests
- **Preflight Requests**: Browsers send OPTIONS requests to check if the actual request is allowed
- **Credentials**: Special handling required for requests with cookies or authentication

If you're exposing your API with a GET request publicly, the only thing you need to do is set the HTTP header `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`. Here are other common CORS headers:

```http
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://example. com
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
```

To implement CORS in FastAPI, use the [`CORSMiddleware` middleware](https://fastapi. tiangolo. com/tutorial/cors/):

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi. middleware. cors import CORSMiddleware

app = FastAPI()

app. add_middleware(CORSMiddleware, allow_origins=[""*""]) # Allow GET requests from all origins
# Or, provide more granular control:
app. add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=[""https://example. com""],  # Allow a specific domain
    allow_credentials=True,  # Allow cookies
    allow_methods=[""GET"", ""POST"", ""PUT"", ""DELETE""],  # Allow specific methods
    allow_headers=[""*""],  # Allow all headers
)
```

Testing CORS with JavaScript:

```javascript
// Simple request
const response = await fetch(""https://api. example. com/data"", {
  method: ""GET"",
  headers: { ""Content-Type"": ""application/json"" },
});

// Request with credentials
const response = await fetch(""https://api. example. com/data"", {
  credentials: ""include"",
  headers: { ""Content-Type"": ""application/json"" },
});
```

Useful CORS debugging tools:

- [CORS Checker](https://cors-test. codehappy. dev/): Test CORS configurations
- Browser DevTools Network tab: Inspect CORS headers and preflight requests
- [cors-anywhere](https://github. com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere): CORS proxy for development

Common CORS errors and solutions:

- `No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header`: Configure server to send proper CORS headers
- `Request header field not allowed`: Add required headers to `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`
- `Credentials flag`: Set both `credentials: 'include'` and `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`
- `Wild card error`: Cannot use `*` with credentials; specify exact origins.",https://tds.s-anand.net/#/cors
crawling-cli,0,a286c3dc-93af-4797-a57b-f44a12875fe8,crawling-cli.md,"## Crawling with the CLI

Since websites are a common source of data, we often download entire websites (crawling) and then process them offline. Web crawling is essential in many data-driven scenarios:

- **Data mining and analysis**: Gathering structured data from multiple pages for market research, competitive analysis, or academic research
- **Content archiving**: Creating offline copies of websites for preservation or backup purposes
- **SEO analysis**: Analyzing site structure, metadata, and content to improve search rankings
- **Legal compliance**: Capturing website content for regulatory or compliance documentation
- **Website migration**: Creating a complete copy before moving to a new platform or design
- **Offline access**: Downloading educational resources, documentation, or reference materials for use without internet connection

The most commonly used tool for fetching websites is [`wget`](https://www. gnu. org/software/wget/). It is pre-installed in many UNIX distributions and easy to install. [![Scraping Websites using Wget (8 min)](https://i. ytimg. com/vi/pLfH5TZBGXo/sddefault. jpg)](https://youtu. be/pLfH5TZBGXo)

To crawl the [IIT Madras Data Science Program website](https://study. iitm. ac. in/ds/) for example, you could run:

```bash
wget \
  --recursive \
  --level=3 \
  --no-parent \
  --convert-links \
  --adjust-extension \
  --compression=auto \
  --accept html,htm \
  --directory-prefix=. /ds \
  https://study. iitm. ac. in/ds/
```

Here's what each option does:

- `--recursive`: Enables recursive downloading (following links)
- `--level=3`: Limits recursion depth to 3 levels from the initial URL
- `--no-parent`: Restricts crawling to only URLs below the initial directory
- `--convert-links`: Converts all links in downloaded documents to work locally
- `--adjust-extension`: Adds proper extensions to files (. html,. jpg, etc. ) based on MIME types
- `--compression=auto`: Automatically handles compressed content (gzip, deflate)
- `--accept html,htm`: Only downloads files with these extensions
- `--directory-prefix=. /ds`: Saves all downloaded files to the specified directory

[wget2](https://gitlab. com/gnuwget/wget2) is a better version of `wget` and supports HTTP2, parallel connections, and only updates modified sites. The syntax is (mostly) the same. ```bash
wget2 \
  --recursive \
  --level=3 \
  --no-parent \
  --convert-links \
  --adjust-extension \
  --compression=auto \
  --accept html,htm \
  --directory-prefix=. /ds \
  https://study. iitm. ac. in/ds/
```

There are popular free and open-source alternatives to Wget:

### Wpull

[Wpull](https://github. com/ArchiveTeam/wpull) is a wget‐compatible Python crawler that supports on-disk resumption, WARC output, and PhantomJS integration. ```bash
uvx wpull \
  --recursive \
  --level=3 \
  --no-parent \
  --convert-links \
  --adjust-extension \
  --compression=auto \
  --accept html,htm \
  --directory-prefix=. /ds \
  https://study. iitm. ac. in/ds/
```

### HTTrack

[HTTrack](https://www. httrack. com/html/fcguide. html) is dedicated website‐mirroring tool with rich filtering and link‐conversion options. ```bash
httrack ""https://study. iitm. ac. in/ds/"" \
  -O "". /ds"" \
  ""+*. study. iitm. ac. in/ds/*"" \
  -r3
```

### Robots. txt

`robots. txt` is a standard file found in a website's root directory that specifies which parts of the site should not be accessed by web crawlers. It's part of the Robots Exclusion Protocol, an ethical standard for web crawling.",https://tds.s-anand.net/#/crawling-cli
crawling-cli,1,fa1eee8b-1340-4fba-a7ae-7602097fe30b,crawling-cli.md,"**Why it's important**:

- **Server load protection**: Prevents excessive traffic that could overload servers
- **Privacy protection**: Keeps sensitive or private content from being indexed
- **Legal compliance**: Respects website owners' rights to control access to their content
- **Ethical web citizenship**: Shows respect for website administrators' wishes

**How to override robots. txt restrictions**:

- **wget, wget2**: Use `-e robots=off`
- **httrack**: Use `-s0`
- **wpull**: Use `--no-robots`

**When to override robots. txt (use with discretion)**:

Only bypass `robots. txt` when:

- You have explicit permission from the website owner
- You're crawling your own website
- The content is publicly accessible and your crawling won't cause server issues
- You're conducting authorized security testing

Remember that bypassing `robots. txt` without legitimate reason may:

- Violate terms of service
- Lead to IP banning
- Result in legal consequences in some jurisdictions
- Cause reputation damage to your organization

Always use the minimum necessary crawling speed and scope, and consider contacting website administrators for permission when in doubt. .",https://tds.s-anand.net/#/crawling-cli

You'll learn basic but essential data cleaning techniques in Excel, covering:

- **Find and Replace**: Use Ctrl+H to replace or remove specific terms (e. g. , removing ""[more]"" from country names). - **Changing Data Formats**: Convert columns from general to numerical format. - **Removing Extra Spaces**: Use the TRIM function to clean up unnecessary spaces in text. - **Identifying and Removing Blank Cells**: Highlight and delete entire rows with blank cells using the ""Go To Special"" function. - **Removing Duplicates**: Use the ""Remove Duplicates"" feature to eliminate duplicate entries, demonstrated with country names.

[![DuckDB](https://i. ytimg. com/vi_webp/fZj6kTwXN1U/sddefault. webp)](https://www. youtube. com/playlist?list=PLw2SS5iImhEThtiGNPiNenOr2tVvLj6H7)

DuckDB's SQL engine can handle large files quickly. Below are common cleaning tasks using the DuckDB CLI. ### Create a Sample Dataset

Let's create a sample dataset that mimics real business data patterns - incomplete customer records, time-series orders, and regional variations. Before working with messy production data, you need a controlled environment to test data cleaning techniques. This sample represents common e-commerce scenarios: missing customer info (20% of orders), seasonal patterns (15-day cycles), and geographic segmentation that drive business decisions like inventory placement and marketing campaigns. ```bash
duckdb sample. duckdb <<'SQL'
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE orders AS
SELECT
  seq AS order_id,
  CASE WHEN seq % 5 = 0 THEN NULL ELSE 'Customer ' || seq END AS customer,
  date '2025-01-01' + CAST(seq % 15 AS INTEGER) AS order_date,
  CASE WHEN seq % 3 = 0 THEN 'Widget ' || seq ELSE 'Gadget ' || seq END AS product,
  round(random()*1000, 2) AS amount,
  CASE WHEN seq % 4 = 0 THEN 'EU' ELSE 'US' END AS region
FROM range(1, 50) tbl(seq);
SQL
```

### Create a Messy CSV

Let's also simulate real-world data export issues - unescaped quotes, missing delimiters, and malformed records that break standard CSV parsers. Data rarely arrives clean. Export systems fail, manual data entry introduces errors, and third-party integrations send malformed files. Learning to handle corrupted CSV files prevents hours of debugging and ensures your data pipeline doesn't break when inevitably receiving bad data from vendors, APIs, or legacy systems. ```bash
cat <<'EOF' > messy_orders. csv
order_id,customer,order_date,product,amount,region
1,Customer 1,2025-01-01,Widget 1,100,US
""2,Customer 2,2025-01-02,Gadget 2,200,US
3,Customer 3,2025-01-03,Gadget 3,300,EU
EOF
```

### Create a Big CSV

Next, we'll create a large dataset to practice memory-efficient processing techniques that handle files too big to fit in RAM. When working with millions of customer records, transaction logs, or sensor data, traditional tools crash or run out of memory. DuckDB's streaming capabilities let you process 100GB+ files on laptops by reading data in chunks, making big data analysis accessible without expensive infrastructure. ```bash
duckdb sample. duckdb <<'SQL'
COPY (SELECT seq AS id, random() AS val FROM range(100000)) TO 'big. csv';
SQL
```

### Exploratory Data Analysis

We need to examine our data structure and quality before making business decisions. Every data analysis starts with understanding what you have - missing values can skew customer segmentation, outliers affect revenue forecasting, and data types determine which analytical techniques work. Quick EDA prevents costly mistakes like launching marketing campaigns based on incomplete customer data or setting prices using corrupted transaction amounts. ```sql
-- Preview and get stats
SELECT * FROM orders LIMIT 5;
DESCRIBE orders;
SELECT COUNT(*) AS n, AVG(amount) AS avg_amount FROM orders;
```

### Converting Data to Other Formats

Let's export cleaned data to formats optimized for different business needs. Analytics teams need Parquet for fast querying, APIs require JSON for web integration, and executives want CSV for Excel compatibility. Format conversion ensures your cleaned data reaches every stakeholder in their preferred format, enabling faster decision-making across departments without forcing everyone to learn SQL.",https://tds.s-anand.net/#/data-preparation-in-duckdb
data-preparation-in-duckdb,1,b38bde8f-1481-4c9a-9afb-143426bbffa2,data-preparation-in-duckdb.md,"```sql
COPY (SELECT * FROM orders) TO 'orders. json' (FORMAT JSON);
COPY (SELECT * FROM orders) TO 'orders. parquet' (FORMAT PARQUET);
```

### Reading Messy CSV

We need to handle corrupted files that would normally crash your data pipeline. Real-world CSV files from vendors, legacy systems, or manual exports often contain malformed rows that break standard parsers. Instead of spending hours manually fixing files or losing critical business data, DuckDB's error handling lets you salvage usable records while identifying problem areas for follow-up with data providers. ```sql
-- Skip bad lines while loading
SELECT *
FROM read_csv_auto('messy_orders. csv', ignore_errors=true);
```

### Handling Missing Values

It's important to address incomplete data that could lead to wrong business conclusions. Missing customer names prevent personalized marketing, absent transaction amounts skew revenue calculations, and incomplete addresses block shipping. Rather than excluding entire records and losing valuable information, strategic imputation preserves data for analysis while clearly marking assumptions made during the cleaning process. ```sql
-- Replace null customer names
SELECT COALESCE(customer, 'Unknown') AS customer FROM orders;
```

### String Operations

It's common to standardize text data that comes from multiple sources with inconsistent formatting. Product names from different suppliers use varying cases, customer entries have extra spaces, and imported data contains mixed formatting. Clean, consistent strings enable accurate grouping for inventory management, prevent duplicate customer records, and ensure search functionality works properly across your application. ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT TRIM(LOWER(product)) AS clean_product FROM orders;
```

### Date Parsing and Conversion

Typically, we transform dates into different formats that enable time-based business analysis. Raw date strings from different systems use various formats that prevent proper sorting and filtering. Converting to standard formats enables monthly sales reporting, seasonal trend analysis, and time-based customer segmentation - critical for inventory planning, marketing campaigns, and financial forecasting. ```sql
SELECT order_id, STRFTIME(order_date, '%Y-%m') AS order_month FROM orders;
```

### Conditional Logic and Binning

A common task is to categorize continuous data into meaningful business segments that drive decision-making. Converting exact dollar amounts into price tiers enables targeted marketing (premium vs budget customers), inventory classification (high/medium/low value items), and commission structures. This segmentation forms the foundation for personalized pricing, customer targeting, and performance analysis. ```sql
SELECT
  order_id,
  CASE WHEN amount > 700 THEN 'high' WHEN amount > 300 THEN 'medium' ELSE 'low' END AS price_band
FROM orders;
```

### Regex Search and Replace

We often need to clean complex text patterns that simple string operations can't handle. Product descriptions contain multiple spaces, phone numbers have inconsistent formatting, and addresses mix abbreviations with full words. Regular expressions fix these patterns systematically, ensuring consistent data quality for customer communications, shipping integrations, and search functionality. ```sql
SELECT REGEXP_REPLACE(product, '\\s+', ' ', 'g') AS tidy_product FROM orders;
```

### Working with Multiple Formats

Let's combine data from different sources that use various file formats. Modern businesses receive data as CSV exports, JSON from APIs, and Parquet from data warehouses.",https://tds.s-anand.net/#/data-preparation-in-duckdb
data-preparation-in-duckdb,2,56e7741c-c3cd-4538-bb73-e230272c4332,data-preparation-in-duckdb.md,"Rather than maintaining separate processing pipelines, DuckDB's format flexibility lets you join orders from your CSV exports with customer data from JSON APIs and inventory levels from Parquet files in a single query. ```sql
CREATE TABLE json_orders AS SELECT * FROM read_json_auto('orders. json');
CREATE TABLE parquet_orders AS SELECT * FROM read_parquet('orders. parquet');
SELECT * FROM orders UNION ALL SELECT * FROM parquet_orders;
```

### Processing in Chunks

We handle massive datasets that exceed available memory by processing them in manageable segments. When analyzing years of transaction logs, customer behavior data, or sensor readings, loading everything at once crashes systems. Chunk processing enables analysis of terabyte-scale datasets on standard hardware, making enterprise-level data analysis accessible for fraud detection, customer lifetime value calculations, and operational analytics. ```sql
SELECT * FROM read_csv_auto('big. csv') LIMIT 1000 OFFSET 0;
SELECT * FROM read_csv_auto('big. csv') LIMIT 1000 OFFSET 1000;
```

### Filtering Rows and Dropping Columns

We'll focus analysis on relevant data subsets while removing sensitive or unnecessary information. Business analysis rarely needs all data - marketing teams want current customers, finance needs profitable regions, and product managers focus on active items. Efficient filtering reduces processing time, protects sensitive data (removing PII columns), and ensures analysis focuses on business-relevant subsets rather than getting lost in comprehensive but unfocused datasets. ```sql
SELECT order_id, amount FROM orders WHERE region = 'US';
SELECT * EXCLUDE region FROM orders;
```

### Derived Columns

Now, let's create new business metrics from existing data that drive key performance indicators. Raw transaction amounts become profit margins with tax calculations, customer regions enable territory-based analysis, and dates support seasonal comparisons. These derived metrics power executive dashboards, sales team performance tracking, and automated business rules without requiring manual calculations or separate reporting tools. ```sql
SELECT *, amount * 0. 1 AS tax, UPPER(region) AS region_code FROM orders;
```

### Summaries and Pivots

A big part of data preparation is to transform detailed transaction data into executive-level insights that inform strategic decisions. Converting thousands of individual orders into regional sales summaries, customer segment performance, and product category trends enables quick identification of growth opportunities, underperforming markets, and inventory optimization needs. These aggregations become the foundation for board presentations, budget planning, and strategic initiatives. ```sql
-- Aggregation
SELECT region, COUNT(*) AS n_orders, SUM(amount) AS total FROM orders GROUP BY region;

-- Pivot by region
SELECT *
FROM orders
PIVOT(COUNT(*) FOR region IN ('US', 'EU'));
```

!ls --help
```

    Usage: ls [OPTION]. . . [FILE]. . . List information about the FILEs (the current directory by default). Sort entries alphabetically if none of -cftuvSUX nor --sort is specified. Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too. -a, --all                  do not ignore entries starting with. -A, --almost-all           do not list implied. and. . --author               with -l, print the author of each file

    The SIZE argument is an integer and optional unit (example: 10K is 10*1024). Units are K,M,G,T,P,E,Z,Y (powers of 1024) or KB,MB,. . . (powers of 1000). Binary prefixes can be used, too: KiB=K, MiB=M, and so on. The TIME_STYLE argument can be full-iso, long-iso, iso, locale, or +FORMAT. FORMAT is interpreted like in date(1).",https://tds.s-anand.net/#/data-preparation-in-the-shell

## Uncompress the log file

`gzip` is the most popular compression format on the web. It's fast and pretty good. (`xz` is much better but slower. )

Since the file has a `. gz` extension, we know it's compressed using `gzip`. We can use `gzip -d FILE. gz` to decompress the file. It'll replace `FILE. gz` with `FILE`. (Compression works the opposite way. `gzip FILE` replaces `FILE` with `FILE. gz`)[link text](https://)

```python
# gzip -d is the same as gunzip. They both decompress a GZIP-ed file
!gzip -d s-anand. net-Apr-2024. gz
```

```python
# Let's list the files and see the size
!ls -l
```

    total 50832
    drwxr-xr-x 1 root root     4096 Jun  6 14:21 sample_data
    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 52044491 Jun  9 05:18 s-anand. net-Apr-2024

In this case, a file that was ~5. 8MiB became ~52MiB, roughly 10 times larger. Clearly, it's more efficient to store and transport compressed files -- especitally if they're plain text. ## Preview the logs

To see the first few lines or the last few lines of a text file, use `head` or `tail`_italicized text_

```python
# Show the first 5 lines

Clearly, the data is from around 31 Mar 2024 a bit after 7 am EST (GMT-5) until 30 Apr 2024, a bit after 7 am EST. Each line is an Apache log record. It has a lot of data. Some are clear. For example, taking the last row:

- `37. 59. 21. 100` is the IP address that made a request. That's from [OVH](https://www. whois. com/whois/37. 59. 21. 100) - a French cloud provider. Maybe a bot. - `[30/Apr/2024:07:11:31 -0500]` is the time of the request
- `""GET /blog/2003-mumbai-bloggers-meet-photos/feed/ HTTP/1. 1""` is the request made to [this page](https://s-anand. net/blog/2003-mumbai-bloggers-meet-photos/feed/)
- `200` is the HTTP reponse status code, indicating that all's well
- `686` bytes was the size of the response
- `""Mozilla/5. 0 (X11; Linux i686) AppleWebKit/537. 36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/30. 0. 1599. 66 Safari/537. 36""` is the user agent. That's Chrome 30 -- a really old versio of Chrome on Linux. Very likely a bot. ## Count requests

`wc` counts the number of lines, words, and characters in a file. The number of lines is most often used with data. ```python
!wc s-anand. net-Apr-2024
```

      208539  4194545 52044491 s-anand. net-Apr-2024

So, in Apr 2024, there were ~208K requests to the site. Useful to know.",https://tds.s-anand.net/#/data-preparation-in-the-shell
data-preparation-in-the-shell,9,b31b8bf4-8580-40b1-9024-8373594c8c16,data-preparation-in-the-shell.md,"I wonder: **Who is sending most of these requests?**

Let's extract the IP addresses and count them. ## Extract the `IP` column

We'll use `cut` to cut the first column. It has 2 options that we'll use. `--delimiter` is the character that splits fields. In the log file, it's a space. (We'll confirm this shortly. )
`--fields` picks the field to cut. We want field 1 (IP address)

Let's preview this:

```python
# Preview just the IP addresses from the logs
!cut --delimiter "" "" --fields 1 s-anand. net-Apr-2024 | head -n 5
```

    17. 241. 219. 11
    17. 241. 75. 154
    101. 44. 248. 120
    17. 241. 227. 200
    37. 59. 21. 100

We used the `|` operator. That passes the output to the next command, `head -n 5`, and gives us first 5 lines. This is called **piping** and is the equivalent of calling a function inside another in programming languages. We'll use `sort` to sort these IP addresses. That puts the same IP addresses next to each other. ```python
# Preview the SORTED IP addresses from the logs
!cut --delimiter "" "" --fields 1 s-anand. net-Apr-2024 | sort | head -n 5
```

    100. 20. 65. 50

    101. 115. 156. 11
    101. 115. 205. 68

There are no duplicates there. . . maybe we need to go a bit further? Let's check the top 25 lines. ```python
# Preview the SORTED IP addresses from the logs
!cut --delimiter "" "" --fields 1 s-anand. net-Apr-2024 | sort | head -n 25

OK, there are some duplicates. Good to know. We'll use `uniq` to count the unique IP addresses. It has a `--count` option that displays the number of unique values. **NOTE**: `uniq` works ONLY on sorted files. You NEED to `sort` first. ```python
!cut --delimiter "" "" --fields 1 s-anand. net-Apr-2024 | sort | uniq --count | head -n 25

That's useful. [101. 2. 187. 83](https://www. whois. com/whois/101. 2. 187. 83) from Colombo visited 7 times. But I'd like to know who visited the MOST. So let's `sort` it further. `sort` has an option `--key 1n` that sorts by field `1` -- the count of IP addresses in this case. The `n` indicates that it's a numeric sort (so 11 appears AFTER 2). Also, we'll use `tail` instead of `head` to get the highest entries. ```python
# Show the top 5 IP addresses by visits
!cut --delimiter "" "" --fields 1 s-anand. net-Apr-2024 | sort | uniq --count | sort --key 1n | tail -n 5

WOW! [136. 243. 228. 193](https://www. whois. com/whois/136. 243. 228. 193) from Dataforseo, Ukraine, sent roughly HALF of ALL the requests!

I wonder if we can figure out what User Agent they send. Is it something that identifies itself as a bot of some kind?

## Find lines matching an IP

`grep` searches for text in files. It uses [Regular Expressions](https://developer. mozilla. org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_expressions) which are a powerful set of wildcards. 💡 TIP: You **MUST** learn regular expressions. They're very helpful. Here, we'll search for all lines BEGINNING with 136. 243. 228. 193 and having a space after that. That's `""^136. 243. 228. 193 ""`. The `^` at the beginning matches the start of a line. ```python
# Preview lines that begin with 136. 243. 228. 193
!grep ""^136. 243. 228. 193 "" s-anand. net-Apr-2024 | head -n 5

Personally, I believe it's more likely to be a bot than a French human so interested in my website that they made over 250 requests _every day_. ## Find bots

But, I'm curious. What are the user agents that DO identify themselves as bots? Let's use `grep` to find all words that match bot. `grep --only-matching` will show only the matches, not the entire line. The regular expression `'\S*bot\S*'` (which ChatGPT generated) finds all words that have bot. - `\S` matches non-space characters
- `\S*` matches 0 or more non-space characters

```python
# Find all words with `bot` in it
!grep --only-matching '\b\w*bot\w*\b' s-anand. net-Apr-2024 | head
```

data-preparation-in-the-shell,12,edc1a605-7f00-4aec-b275-6a8a4cedfc99,data-preparation-in-the-shell.md,"Instead of `[31/Mar/2024:11:27:43 -0500]` it should have been `""31/Mar/2024:11:27:43 -0500""`

We'll use `sed` (stream editor) to replace the characters. `sed` is like `grep` but lets you replace, not just search. (Actually, `sed` can do a lot more. It's a full-fledged editor. You can insert, delete, edit, etc. programmatically. In fact, `sed` has truly remarkable features that this paragraph is too small to contain. )

The regular expression we will use is `\[\([^]]*\)\]`. The way this works is:

- `\[`: Match the opening square bracket. - `\([^]]*\)`: Capture everything inside the square brackets (non-greedy match for any character except `]`). - `\]`: Match the closing square bracket. BTW, I didn't create this. [ChatGPT did](https://chatgpt. com/share/7f14e9d2-15ec-4562-b263-61547d2230f3). `sed ""s/abc/xyz/"" FILE` replaces `abc` with `xyz` in the file. We can use the regular expression above for the search and `""\1""` for the value -- it inserts captured group enclosed in double quotes. ```python
# Replace [datetime] etc. with ""datetime"" and save as log. csv
!sed 's/\[\([^]]*\)\]/""\1""/' s-anand. net-Apr-2024 > log. csv
```

```python
# We should now have a log. csv that's roughly the same size as the original file. !ls -l
```

    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 52044491 Jun  9 05:19 log. csv
    drwxr-xr-x 1 root root     4096 Jun  6 14:21 sample_data
    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 52044491 Jun  9 05:18 s-anand. net-Apr-2024

You can download this `log. csv` and open it in Excel as a CSV file with space as the delimiter. But when I did that, I faced another problem. Some of the lines had extra columns. That's because the ""User Agent"" values sometimes contain a quote. CSV files are supposed to escape quotes with `""""` -- two double quotes. But Apache uses `\""` instead. I'll leave it as an exercise for you to fix that. ## More commands

We've covered the commands most often used to process data before analysis. Here are a few more that you'll find useful. - `cat` concatenates multiple files. You can join multiple log files with this, for example
- `awk` is almost a full-fledged programming interface. It's often used for summing up values
- `less` lets you open and read files, scrolling through it

Data preparation is crucial because raw data is rarely perfect. It often contains errors, inconsistencies, or missing values. For example, marks data may have 'NA' or 'absent' for non-attendees, which you need to handle. This section teaches you how to clean up data, convert it to different formats, aggregate it if required, and get a feel for the data before you analyze. Here are links used in the video:

Before you do any kind of data science, you obviously have to get the data to be able to analyze it, visualize it, narrate it, and deploy it. And what we are going to cover in this module is how you get the data. There are three ways you can get the data. 1. The first is you can **download** the data. Either somebody gives you the data and says download it from here, or you are asked to download it from the internet because it's a public data source. But that's the first way—you download the data. 2. The second way is you can **query it** from somewhere. It may be on a database. It may be available through an API. It may be available through a library. But these are ways in which you can selectively query parts of the data and stitch it together. 3. The third way is you have to **scrape it**. It's not directly available in a convenient form that you can query or download. But it is, in fact, on a web page. It's available on a PDF file. It's available in a Word document. It's available on an Excel file. It's kind of structured, but you will have to figure out that structure and extract it from there. In this module, we will be looking at the tools that will help you either download from a data source or query from an API or from a database or from a library. And finally, how you can scrape from different sources. [![Data Sourcing - Introduction](https://i. ytimg. com/vi_webp/1LyblMkJzOo/sddefault. webp)](https://youtu. be/1LyblMkJzOo)

docker,0,d11b2385-b509-4f49-9a17-58a362fdec3d,docker.md,"## Containers: Docker, Podman

[Docker](https://www. docker. com/) and [Podman](https://podman. io/) are containerization tools that package your application and its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development and deployment. Docker is the industry standard. Podman is compatible with Docker and has better security (and a slightly more open license). In this course, we recommend Podman but Docker works in the same way. Initialize the container engine:

```bash
podman machine init
podman machine start
```

Common Operations. (You can use `docker` instead of `podman` in the same way. )

```bash
# Pull an image
podman pull python:3. 11-slim

# Run a container
podman run -it python:3. 11-slim

# List containers
podman ps -a

# Stop container
podman stop container_id

# Scan image for vulnerabilities
podman scan myapp:latest

# Remove container
podman rm container_id

# Remove all stopped containers
podman container prune
```

You can create a `Dockerfile` to build a container image. Here's a sample `Dockerfile` that converts a Python script into a container image. ```dockerfile
FROM python:3. 11-slim
# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app
# Typically, you would use `COPY. . ` to copy files from the host machine,
# but here we're just using a simple script. RUN echo 'print(""Hello, world!"")' > app. py
# Run the script
CMD [""python"", ""app. py""]
```

To build, run, and deploy the container, run these commands:

```bash
# Create an account on https://hub. docker. com/ and then login
podman login docker. io

# Build and run the container
podman build -t py-hello. podman run -it py-hello

# Push the container to Docker Hub. Replace $DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME with your Docker Hub username. podman push py-hello:latest docker. io/$DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/py-hello

# Push adding a specific tag, e. g. dev
TAG=dev podman push py-hello docker. io/$DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/py-hello:$TAG

embeddings,0,0b4781db-9e6a-4988-85b5-bc42fcb35606,embeddings.md,"## Embeddings: OpenAI and Local Models

Embedding models convert text into a list of numbers. These are like a map of text in numerical form. Each number represents a feature, and similar texts will have numbers close to each other. So, if the numbers are similar, the text they represent mean something similar. This is useful because text similarity is important in many common problems:

1. **Search**. Find similar documents to a query. 2. **Classification**. Classify text into categories. 3. **Clustering**. Group similar items into clusters. 4. **Anomaly Detection**. Find an unusual piece of text. You can run embedding models locally or using an API. Local models are better for privacy and cost. APIs are better for scale and quality. | Feature     | Local Models               | API                       |
| ----------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Privacy** | High                       | Dependent on provider     |
| **Cost**    | High setup, low after that | Pay-as-you-go             |
| **Scale**   | Limited by local resources | Easily scales with demand |
| **Quality** | Varies by model            | Typically high            |

The [Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB)](https://huggingface. co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard) provides comprehensive comparisons of embedding models. These models are compared on several parameters, but here are some key ones to look at:

1. **Rank**. Higher ranked models have higher quality. 2. **Memory Usage**. Lower is better (for similar ranks). It costs less and is faster to run. 3. **Embedding Dimensions**. Lower is better. This is the number of numbers in the array. Smaller dimensions are cheaper to store. 4. **Max Tokens**. Higher is better. This is the number of input tokens (words) the model can take in a _single_ input. 5. Look for higher scores in the columns for Classification, Clustering, Summarization, etc. based on your needs. ### Local Embeddings

[![Guide to Local Embeddings with Sentence Transformers](https://i. ytimg. com/vi/OATCgQtNX2o/sddefault. jpg)](https://youtu. be/OATCgQtNX2o)

Here's a minimal example using a local embedding model:

```python
# /// script
# requires-python = ""==3. 12""
# dependencies = [
#   ""sentence-transformers"",
#   ""httpx"",
#   ""numpy"",
# ]
# ///

from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
import numpy as np

model = SentenceTransformer('BAAI/bge-base-en-v1. 5')  # A small, high quality model

async def embed(text: str) -> list[float]:
    """"""Get embedding vector for text using local model. """"""
    return model. encode(text). tolist()

async def get_similarity(text1: str, text2: str) -> float:
    """"""Calculate cosine similarity between two texts. """"""
    emb1 = np. array(await embed(text1))
    emb2 = np. array(await embed(text2))
    return float(np. dot(emb1, emb2) / (np. linalg. norm(emb1) * np. linalg. norm(emb2)))

async def main():
    print(await get_similarity(""Apple"", ""Orange""))
    print(await get_similarity(""Apple"", ""Lightning""))


if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    import asyncio
    asyncio. run(main())
```

Note the `get_similarity` function. It uses a [Cosine Similarity](https://en. wikipedia. org/wiki/Cosine_similarity) to calculate the similarity between two embeddings. ### OpenAI Embeddings

For comparison, here's how to use OpenAI's API with direct HTTP calls. Replace the `embed` function in the earlier script:

```python
import os
import httpx

async def embed(text: str) -> list[float]:
    """"""Get embedding vector for text using OpenAI's API. """"""
    async with httpx. AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client. post(
            ""https://api. openai. com/v1/embeddings"",
            headers={""Authorization"": f""Bearer {os.",https://tds.s-anand.net/#/embeddings

        )
        return response. json()[""data""][0][""embedding""]
```

## Media Processing: FFmpeg

[FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg. org/) is the standard command-line tool for processing video and audio files. It's essential for data scientists working with media files for:

- Extracting audio/video for machine learning
- Converting formats for web deployment
- Creating visualizations and presentations
- Processing large media datasets

Basic Operations:

```bash
# Basic conversion
ffmpeg -i input. mp4 output. avi

# Extract audio
ffmpeg -i input. mp4 -vn output. mp3

# Convert format without re-encoding
ffmpeg -i input. mkv -c copy output. mp4

# High quality encoding (crf: 0-51, lower is better)
ffmpeg -i input. mp4 -preset slower -crf 18 output. mp4
```

Common Data Science Tasks:

```bash
# Extract frames for computer vision
ffmpeg -i input. mp4 -vf ""fps=1"" frames_%04d. png    # 1 frame per second
ffmpeg -i input. mp4 -vf ""select='eq(n,0)'"" -vframes 1 first_frame. jpg

# Create video from image sequence
ffmpeg -r 1/5 -i img%03d. png -c:v libx264 -vf fps=25 output. mp4

# Extract audio for speech recognition
ffmpeg -i input. mp4 -ar 16000 -ac 1 audio. wav      # 16kHz mono

# Trim video/audio for training data
ffmpeg -ss 00:01:00 -i input. mp4 -t 00:00:30 -c copy clip. mp4
```

Processing Multiple Files:

```bash
# Concatenate videos (first create files. txt with list of files)
echo ""file 'input1. mp4'
file 'input2. mp4'"" > files. txt
ffmpeg -f concat -i files. txt -c copy output. mp4

# Batch process with shell loop
for f in *. mp4; do
    ffmpeg -i ""$f"" -vn ""audio/${f%. mp4}. wav""
done
```

Data Analysis Features:

```bash
# Get media file information
ffprobe -v quiet -print_format json -show_format -show_streams input. mp4

# Display frame metadata
ffprobe -v quiet -print_format json -show_frames input. mp4

# Generate video thumbnails
ffmpeg -i input. mp4 -vf ""thumbnail"" -frames:v 1 thumb. jpg
```

3. Use `-hide_banner` to reduce output verbosity
4. Test commands with small clips first
5. Use hardware acceleration when available (-hwaccel auto)

Error Handling:

```bash
# Validate file before processing
ffprobe input. mp4 2>&1 | grep ""Invalid""

# Continue on errors in batch processing
ffmpeg -i input. mp4 output. mp4 -xerror

# Get detailed error information
ffmpeg -v error -i input. mp4 2>&1 | grep -A2 ""Error""
```

Note: Always respect copyright and terms of service when downloading content. ## Whisper transcription

[Faster Whisper](https://github. com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper) is a highly optimized implementation of OpenAI's [Whisper model](https://github. com/openai/whisper), offering up to 4x faster transcription while using less memory. You can install it via:

- `pip install faster-whisper`
- [Download Windows Standalone](https://github. com/Purfview/whisper-standalone-win/releases)

Here's a basic usage example:

```bash
faster-whisper-xxl ""video. mp4"" --model medium --language en
```

Here's my recommendation for transcribing videos. This saves the output in JSON as well as SRT format in the source directory. ```bash
faster-whisper-xxl --print_progress --output_dir source --batch_recursive \
                   --check_files --standard --output_format json srt \
                   --model medium --language en $FILE
```

- `--model`: The OpenAI Whisper model to use. You can choose from:
  - `tiny`: Fastest but least accurate
  - `base`: Good for simple audio
  - `small`: Balanced speed/accuracy
  - `medium`: Recommended default
  - `large-v3`: Most accurate but slowest
- `--output_format`: The output format to use. You can pick multiple formats from:
  - `json`: Has the most detailed information including timing, text, quality, etc. - `srt`: A popular subtitle format. You can use this in YouTube, for example. - `vtt`: A modern subtitle format. - `txt`: Just the text transcript
- `--output_dir`: The directory to save the output files. `source` indicates the source directory, i. e. where the input `$FILE` is
- `--language`: The language of the input file. If you don't specify it, it analyzes the first 30 seconds to auto-detect. You can speed it up by specifying it. Run `faster-whisper-xxl --help` for more options. ## Gemini transcription

The [Gemini](https://gemini. google. com/) models from Google are notable in two ways:

1. They have a _huge_ input context window. Gemini 2. 0 Flash can accept 1M tokens, for example. 2. They can handle audio input. This allows us to use Gemini to transcribe audio files. LLMs are not good at transcribing audio _faithfully_.",https://tds.s-anand.net/#/extracting-audio-and-transcripts
extracting-audio-and-transcripts,2,52e1cd7b-2005-49d2-b383-07caeece30b8,extracting-audio-and-transcripts.md,"They tend to correct errors and meander from what was said. But they are intelligent. That enables a few powerful workflows. Here are some examples:

1. **Transcribe into other languages**. Gemini will handle the transcription and translation in a single step. 2. **Summarize audio transcripts**. For example, convert a podcast into a tutorial, or a meeting recording into actions. 3. **Legal Proceeding Analysis**. Extract case citations, dates, and other details from a legal debate. 4. **Medical Consultation Summary**. Extract treatments, medications, details of next visit, etc. from a medical consultation. Here's how to use Gemini to transcribe audio files. 1. Get a [Gemini API key](https://aistudio. google. com/app/apikey) from Google AI Studio. 2. Set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable to the API key. 3. Set the `MP3_FILE` environment variable to the path of the MP3 file you want to transcribe. 4. Run this code:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://generativelanguage. googleapis. com/v1beta/models/gemini-1. 5-flash-002:streamGenerateContent?alt=sse \
     -H ""X-Goog-API-Key: $GEMINI_API_KEY"" \

fastapi,0,690f7ebb-fdc5-490e-b199-878f4557f9ee,fastapi.md,"## Web Framework: FastAPI

[FastAPI](https://fastapi. tiangolo. com/) is a modern Python web framework for building APIs with automatic interactive documentation. It's fast, easy to use, and designed for building production-ready REST APIs. Here's a minimal FastAPI app, `app. py`:

```python
# /// script
# requires-python = "">=3. 11""
# dependencies = [
#   ""fastapi"",
#   ""uvicorn"",
# ]
# ///

from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app. get(""/"")
async def root():
    return {""message"": ""Hello!""}

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn. run(app, host=""0. 0. 0. 0"", port=8000)
```

Run this with `uv run app. py`. 1. **Handle errors by raising HTTPException**

   ```python
   from fastapi import HTTPException

   async def get_item(item_id: int):
       if not valid_item(item_id):
           raise HTTPException(
               status_code=404,
               detail=f""Item {item_id} not found""
           )
   ```

2. **Use middleware for logging**

   ```python
   from fastapi import Request
   import time

   @app. middleware(""http"")
   async def add_timing(request: Request, call_next):
       start = time. time()
       response = await call_next(request)
       response. headers[""X-Process-Time""] = str(time. time() - start)
       return response
   ```

[Function Calling](https://platform. openai. com/docs/guides/function-calling) allows Large Language Models to convert natural language into structured function calls. This is perfect for building chatbots and AI assistants that need to interact with your backend systems. OpenAI supports [Function Calling](https://platform. openai. com/docs/guides/function-calling) -- a way for LLMs to suggest what functions to call and how. [![OpenAI Function Calling - Full Beginner Tutorial](https://i. ytimg. com/vi_webp/aqdWSYWC_LI/sddefault. webp)](https://youtu. be/aqdWSYWC_LI)

Here's a minimal example using Python and OpenAI's function calling that identifies the weather in a given location. ```python

# requires-python = "">=3. 11""
# dependencies = [
#   ""httpx"",
# ]
# ///

    response = query_gpt(""What is the weather in San Francisco?"", [WEATHER_TOOL])
    print([tool_call[""function""] for tool_call in response[""tool_calls""]])
```

### How to define functions

The function definition is a [JSON schema](https://json-schema. org/) with a few OpenAI specific properties. See the [Supported schemas](https://platform. openai. com/docs/guides/structured-outputs#supported-schemas). Here's an example of a function definition for scheduling a meeting:

```python
MEETING_TOOL = {
    ""type"": ""function"",
    ""function"": {
        ""name"": ""schedule_meeting"",
        ""description"": ""Schedule a meeting room for a specific date and time"",
        ""parameters"": {
            ""type"": ""object"",
            ""properties"": {
                ""date"": {
                    ""type"": ""string"",
                    ""description"": ""Meeting date in YYYY-MM-DD format""
                },
                ""time"": {
                    ""type"": ""string"",
                    ""description"": ""Meeting time in HH:MM format""
                },
                ""meeting_room"": {
                    ""type"": ""string"",
                    ""description"": ""Name of the meeting room""
                }
            },
            ""required"": [""date"", ""time"", ""meeting_room""],
            ""additionalProperties"": False
        },
        ""strict"": True
    }
}
```

### How to define multiple functions

You can define multiple functions by passing a list of function definitions to the `tools` parameter. Here's an example of a list of function definitions for handling employee expenses and calculating performance bonuses:

```python
tools = [
    {
        ""type"": ""function"",
        ""function"": {
            ""name"": ""get_expense_balance"",
            ""description"": ""Get expense balance for an employee"",
            ""parameters"": {
                ""type"": ""object"",
                ""properties"": {
                    ""employee_id"": {
                        ""type"": ""integer"",
                        ""description"": ""Employee ID number""
                    }
                },
                ""required"": [""employee_id""],
                ""additionalProperties"": False
            },
            ""strict"": True
        }
    },
    {
        ""type"": ""function"",
        ""function"": {
            ""name"": ""calculate_performance_bonus"",
            ""description"": ""Calculate yearly performance bonus for an employee"",
            ""parameters"": {
                ""type"": ""object"",
                ""properties"": {
                    ""employee_id"": {
                        ""type"": ""integer"",
                        ""description"": ""Employee ID number""
                    },
                    ""current_year"": {
                        ""type"": ""integer"",
                        ""description"": ""Year to calculate bonus for""
                    }
                },
                ""required"": [""employee_id"", ""current_year""],
                ""additionalProperties"": False
            },
            ""strict"": True
        }
    }
]
```

Best Practices:

1. **Use Strict Mode**
   - Always set `strict: True` to ensure valid function calls
   - Define all required parameters
   - Set `additionalProperties: False`
2.",https://tds.s-anand.net/#/function-calling
function-calling,1,c3b8a6e2-53ea-4cf3-be69-6aca915f697f,function-calling.md,"**Use tool choice**
   - Set `tool_choice: ""required""` to ensure that the model will always call one or more tools
   - The default is `tool_choice: ""auto""` which means the model will choose a tool only if appropriate
3. **Clear Descriptions**
   - Write detailed function and parameter descriptions
   - Include expected formats and units
   - Mention any constraints or limitations
4. **Error Handling**
   - Validate function inputs before execution
   - Return clear error messages
   - Handle missing or invalid parameters.",https://tds.s-anand.net/#/function-calling

[GitHub Pages](https://pages. github. com/) is a free hosting service that turns your GitHub repository directly into a static website whenever you push it. This is useful for sharing analysis results, data science portfolios, project documentation, and more. Common Operations:

```bash
# Create a new GitHub repo
mkdir my-site
cd my-site
git init

# Add your static content
echo ""<h1>My Site</h1>"" > index. html

# Push to GitHub
git add. git commit -m ""feat(pages): initial commit""
git push origin main

# Enable GitHub Pages from the main branch on the repo settings page
```

Best Practices:

1. **Keep it small**
   - [Optimize images](https://developer. mozilla. org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Performance/Multimedia). Prefer SVG over WEBP over 8-bit PNG. - [Preload](https://developer. mozilla. org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel/preload) critical assets like stylesheets
   - Avoid committing large files like datasets, videos, etc. directly. Explore [Git LFS](https://git-lfs. github. com/) instead. Tools:

- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop. github. com/): GUI for Git operations
- [GitHub CLI](https://cli. github. com/): Command line interface

Secure your API endpoints using Google ID tokens to restrict access to specific email addresses. [![🔥 Python FastAPI Google Login Tutorial | OAuth2 Authentication (19 min)](https://i. ytimg. com/vi_webp/4ExQYRCwbzw/sddefault. webp)](https://youtu. be/4ExQYRCwbzw)

Google Auth is the most commonly implemented single sign-on mechanism because:

- It's popular and user-friendly. Users can log in with their existing Google accounts. - It's secure: Google supports OAuth2 and OpenID Connect to handle authentication. Here's how you build a FastAPI app that identifies the user. 1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console – Credentials](https://console. developers. google. com/apis/credentials) and click **Create Credentials > OAuth client ID**. 2. Choose **Web application**, set your authorized redirect URIs (e. g. , `http://localhost:8000/`). 3. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** into a `. env` file:

   ```env
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id. apps. googleusercontent. com
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
   ```

4. Create your FastAPI `app. py`:

```python
# /// script
# dependencies = [""python-dotenv"", ""fastapi"", ""uvicorn"", ""itsdangerous"", ""httpx"", ""authlib""]
# ///

import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from fastapi. responses import RedirectResponse
from starlette. middleware. sessions import SessionMiddleware
from authlib. integrations. starlette_client import OAuth

load_dotenv()
app = FastAPI()
app. add_middleware(SessionMiddleware, secret_key=""create-a-random-secret-key"")

oauth = OAuth()
oauth. register(
    name=""google"",
    client_id=os. getenv(""GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID""),
    client_secret=os. getenv(""GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET""),
    server_metadata_url=""https://accounts. google. com/. well-known/openid-configuration"",
    client_kwargs={""scope"": ""openid email profile""},
)

@app. get(""/"")
async def application(request: Request):
    user = request. session. get(""user"")
    # 3. For authenticated users: say hello
    if user:
        return f""Hello {user['email']}""
    # 2. For users who have just logged in, save their details in the session
    if ""code"" in request. query_params:
        token = await oauth. google. authorize_access_token(request)
        request. session[""user""] = token[""userinfo""]
        return RedirectResponse(""/"")
    # 1. For users who are logging in for the first time, redirect to Google login
    return await oauth. google. authorize_redirect(request, request. url)

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn. run(app, port=8000)
```

Now, run `uv run app. py`. 1. When you visit <http://localhost:8000/> you'll be redirected to a Google login page. 2. When you log in, you'll be redirected back to http://localhost:8000/
3. Now you'll see the email ID you logged in with. Instead of displaying the email, you can show different content based on the user. For example:

- Allow access to specfic users and not others
- Fetch the user's personalized information
- Display different content based on the user.",https://tds.s-anand.net/#/google-auth
hybrid-rag-typesense,0,369073b6-1bc4-4783-8bd0-8b5350ddb4a4,hybrid-rag-typesense.md,"## Hybrid Retrieval Augmented Generation (Hybrid RAG) with TypeSense

Hybrid RAG combines semantic (vector) search with traditional keyword search to improve retrieval accuracy and relevance. By mixing exact text matches with embedding-based similarity, you get the best of both worlds: precision when keywords are present, and semantic recall when phrasing varies. [TypeSense](https://typesense. org/) makes this easy with built-in hybrid search and automatic embedding generation. Below is a fully self-contained Hybrid RAG tutorial using TypeSense, Python, and the command line. ### Install and run TypeSense

[Install TypeSense](https://typesense. org/docs/guide/install-typesense. html). ```bash
mkdir typesense-data

docker run -p 8108:8108 \
  -v typesense-data:/data typesense/typesense:28. 0 \
  --data-dir /data \
  --api-key=secret-key \
  --enable-cors
```

- **`docker run`**: spins up a containerized TypeSense server on port 8108
  - `-p 8108:8108` maps host port to container port. - `-v typesense-data:/data` mounts a Docker volume for persistence. - `--data-dir /data` points TypeSense at that volume. - `--api-key=secret-key` secures your API. - `--enable-cors` allows browser-based requests. **Expected output:**

- Docker logs showing TypeSense startup messages, such as `Started Typesense API server`. - Listening on `http://0. 0. 0. 0:8108`. ### Embed and import documents into TypeSense

Follow the steps in the [RAG with the CLI](rag-cli. md) tutorial to create a `chunks. json` that has one `{id, content}` JSON object per line. [TypeSense supports automatic embedding of documents](https://typesense. org/docs/28. 0/api/vector-search. html#option-b-auto-embedding-generation-within-typesense). We'll use that capability. Save the following as `addnotes. py` and run it with `uv run addnotes. py`. ```python
# /// script
# requires-python = "">=3. 13""
# dependencies = [""httpx""]
# ///
import json
import httpx
import os

headers = {""X-TYPESENSE-API-KEY"": ""secret-key""}

schema = {
    ""name"": ""notes"",
    ""fields"": [
        {""name"": ""id"", ""type"": ""string"", ""facet"": False},
        {""name"": ""content"", ""type"": ""string"", ""facet"": False},
        {
            ""name"": ""embedding"",
            ""type"": ""float[]"",
            ""embed"": {
                ""from"": [""content""],
                ""model_config"": {
                    ""model_name"": ""openai/text-embedding-3-small"",
                    ""api_key"": os. getenv(""OPENAI_API_KEY""),
                },
            },
        },
    ],
}

with open(""chunks. json"", ""r"") as f:
    chunks = [json. loads(line) for line in f. readlines()]

with httpx. Client() as client:
    # Create the collection
    if client. get(f""http://localhost:8108/collections/notes"", headers=headers). status_code == 404:
        r = client. post(""http://localhost:8108/collections"", json=schema, headers=headers)

    # Embed the chunks
    result = client. post(
        ""http://localhost:8108/collections/notes/documents/import?action=emplace"",
        headers={**headers, ""Content-Type"": ""text/plain""},
        data=""\n"". join(json. dumps(chunk) for chunk in chunks),
    )
    print(result. text)
```

- **`httpx. Client`**: an HTTP client for Python. - **Collection schema**: `id` and `content` fields plus an `embedding` field with auto-generated embeddings from OpenAI. - **Auto-embedding**: the `embed` block instructs TypeSense to call the specified model for each document. - **`GET /collections/notes`**: checks existence. - **`POST /collections`**: creates the collection. - **`POST /collections/notes/documents/import?action=emplace`**: bulk upsert documents, embedding them on the fly. **Expected output:**

- A JSON summary string like `{""success"": X, ""failed"": 0}` indicating how many docs were imported. - (On timeouts, re-run until all chunks are processed. )

### 4. Run a hybrid search and answer a question

Now, we can use a single `curl` against the Multi-Search endpoint to combine keyword and vector search as a [hybrid search](https://typesense. org/docs/28. 0/api/vector-search.",https://tds.s-anand.net/#/hybrid-rag-typesense
hybrid-rag-typesense,1,2066a068-3a20-45c4-8858-3de981caaf52,hybrid-rag-typesense.md,"html#hybrid-search):

```bash
Q=""What does the author affectionately call the => syntax?""

payload=$(jq -n --arg coll ""notes"" --arg q ""$Q"" \
  '{
     searches: [
       {
         collection: $coll,
         q:           $q,
         query_by:    ""content,embedding"",
         sort_by:     ""_text_match:desc"",
         prefix:      false,
         exclude_fields: ""embedding""
       }
     ]
   }'
)
curl -s 'http://localhost:8108/multi_search' \
  -H ""X-TYPESENSE-API-KEY: secret-key"" \
  -d ""$payload"" \
  | jq -r '. results[]. hits[]. document. content' \
  | llm -s ""${Q} - \$Answer ONLY from these notes. Cite verbatim from the notes. "" \
  | uvx streamdown
```

- **`query_by: ""content,embedding""`**: tells TypeSense to score by both keyword and vector similarity. - **`sort_by: ""_text_match:desc""`**: boosts exact text hits. - **`exclude_fields: ""embedding""`**: keeps responses lightweight. - **`curl -d`**: posts the search request. - **`jq -r`**: extracts each hit’s `content`. See [jq manual](https://stedolan. github. io/jq/manual/)
- **`llm -s`** and **`uvx streamdown`**: generate and stream a grounded answer. **Expected output:**

- The raw matched snippets printed first. - Then a concise, streamed LLM answer citing the note verbatim. .",https://tds.s-anand.net/#/hybrid-rag-typesense
image-compression,0,93c64ca8-9d6d-488a-ab92-fdc59c6c3262,image-compression.md,"## Images: Compression

Image compression is essential when deploying apps. Often, pages have dozens of images. Image analysis runs over thousands of images. The cost of storage and bandwidth can grow over time. Here are things you should know when you're compressing images:

- **Image dimensions** are the width and height of the image in pixels. This impacts image size a lot
- **Lossless** compression (PNG, WebP) preserves exact data
- **Lossy** compression (JPEG, WebP) removes some data for smaller files
- **Vector** formats (SVG) scale without quality loss
- **WebP** is the modern standard, supporting both lossy and lossless

Here's a rule of thumb you can use as of 2025. - Use SVG if you can (i. e. if it's vector graphics or you can convert it to one)
- Else, reduce the image to as small as you can, and save as (lossy or lossless) WebP

Common operations with Python:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from PIL import Image
import io

async def compress_image(input_path: Path, output_path: Path, quality: int = 85) -> None:
    """"""Compress an image while maintaining reasonable quality. """"""
    with Image. open(input_path) as img:
        # Convert RGBA to RGB if needed
        if img. mode == 'RGBA':
            img = img. convert('RGB')
        # Optimize for web
        img. save(output_path, 'WEBP', quality=quality, optimize=True)

# Batch process images
paths = Path('images'). glob('*. jpg')
for p in paths:
    await compress_image(p, p. with_suffix('. webp'))
```

Command line tools include [cwebp](https://developers. google. com/speed/webp/docs/cwebp), [pngquant](https://pngquant. org/), [jpegoptim](https://github. com/tjko/jpegoptim), and [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick. org/). ```bash
# Convert to WebP
cwebp -q 85 input. png -o output. webp

# Optimize PNG
pngquant --quality=65-80 image. png

# Optimize JPEG
jpegoptim --strip-all --all-progressive --max=85 image. jpg

# Convert and resize

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is the de facto standard format for data exchange on the web and APIs. Its human-readable format and widespread support make it essential for data scientists working with web services, APIs, and configuration files. For data scientists, JSON is essential when:

- Working with REST APIs and web services
- Storing configuration files and metadata
- Parsing semi-structured data from databases like MongoDB
- Creating data visualization specifications (e. g. , Vega-Lite)

Watch this comprehensive introduction to JSON (15 min):

[![JSON Crash Course](https://i. ytimg. com/vi_webp/GpOO5iKzOmY/sddefault. webp)](https://youtu. be/GpOO5iKzOmY)

Key concepts to understand in JSON:

- JSON only supports 6 data types: strings, numbers, booleans, null, arrays, and objects
- You can nest data. Arrays and objects can contain other data types, including other arrays and objects
- Always validate. Ensure JSON is well-formed. Comm errors: Trailing commas, missing quotes, and escape characters

[JSON Lines](https://jsonlines. org/) is a format that allows you to store multiple JSON objects in a single line. It's useful for logging and streaming data. Tools you could use with JSON:

- [JSONLint](https://jsonlint. com/): Validate and format JSON
- [JSON Editor Online](https://jsoneditoronline. org/): Visual JSON editor and formatter
- [JSON Schema](https://json-schema. org/): Define the structure of your JSON data
- [jq](https://stedolan. github. io/jq/): Command-line JSON processor

Common Python operations with JSON:

```python
import json

# Parse JSON string
json_str = '{""name"": ""Alice"", ""age"": 30}'
data = json. loads(json_str)

# Convert to JSON string
json_str = json. dumps(data, indent=2)

# Read JSON from file
with open('data. json') as f:
    data = json. load(f)

# Write JSON to file
with open('output. json', 'w') as f:
    json. dump(data, f, indent=2)

# Read JSON data a Pandas DataFrame. JSON data is typically stored as an array of objects. import pandas as pd
df = pd. read_json('data. json')

# Read JSON lines from file into a DataFrame. JSON lines are typically one line per object. df = pd. read_json('data. jsonl', lines=True)
```

1. Replace `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, i. e. `https://api. openai. com/v1` with `https://aipipe. org/openrouter/v1. . . ` or `https://aipipe. org/openai/v1. . . `
2. Replace `OPENAI_API_KEY` with the [`AIPIPE_TOKEN`](https://aipipe. org/login)
3. Replace model names, e. g. `gpt-4. 1-nano`, with `openai/gpt-4. 1-nano`

For example, let's use [Gemini 2. 0 Flash Lite](https://cloud. google. com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/gemini/2-0-flash-lite) via [OpenRouter](https://openrouter. ai/google/gemini-2. 0-flash-lite-001) for chat completions and [Text Embedding 3 Small](https://platform. openai. com/docs/models/text-embedding-3-small) via [OpenAI](https://platform. openai. com/docs/) for embeddings:

```bash
curl https://aipipe. org/openrouter/v1/chat/completions \
  -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" \
  -H ""Authorization: Bearer $AIPIPE_TOKEN"" \
  -d '{
    ""model"": ""google/gemini-2. 0-flash-lite-001"",
    ""messages"": [{ ""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""What is 2 + 2?""} }]
  }'

curl https://aipipe. org/openai/v1/embeddings \
  -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" \
  -H ""Authorization: Bearer $AIPIPE_TOKEN"" \
  -d '{ ""model"": ""text-embedding-3-small"", ""input"": ""What is 2 + 2?"" }'
```

Or using [`llm`](https://llm. datasette. io/):

```bash
llm keys set openai --value $AIPIPE_TOKEN

export OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://aipipe. org/openrouter/v1
llm 'What is 2 + 2?' -m openrouter/google/gemini-2. 0-flash-lite-001

export OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://aipipe. org/openai/v1
llm embed -c 'What is 2 + 2' -m 3-small
```

**For a 50% discount** (but slower speed), use [Flex processing](https://platform. openai. com/docs/guides/flex-processing) by adding `service_tier: ""flex""` to your JSON request. ## AI Proxy - Jan 2025

For the Jan 2025 batch, we had created API keys for everyone with an `iitm. ac. in` email to use `gpt-4o-mini` and `text-embedding-3-small`. Your usage is limited to **$1 per calendar month** for this course. Don't exceed that. **Use [AI Proxy](https://github. com/sanand0/aiproxy)** instead of OpenAI. Specifically:

1. Replace your API to `https://api. openai. com/. . . ` with `https://aiproxy. sanand. workers. dev/openai/. . . `
2. Replace the `OPENAI_API_KEY` with the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` that someone will give you. .",https://tds.s-anand.net/#/large-language-models

LLM Agents are AI systems that can define and execute their own workflows to accomplish tasks. Unlike simple prompt-response patterns, agents make multiple LLM calls, use tools, and adapt their approach based on intermediate results. They represent a significant step toward more autonomous AI systems. [![Building LLM Agents with LangChain (13 min)](https://i. ytimg. com/vi_webp/DWUdGhRrv2c/sddefault. webp)](https://youtu. be/DWUdGhRrv2c)

### What Makes an Agent?

An LLM agent consists of three core components:

1. **LLM Brain**: Makes decisions about what to do next
2. **Tools**: External capabilities the agent can use (e. g. , web search, code execution)
3. **Memory**: Retains context across multiple steps

Agents operate through a loop:

- Observe the environment
- Think about what to do
- Take action using tools
- Observe results
- Repeat until task completion

### Command-Line Agent Example

We've created a minimal command-line agent called [`llm-cmd-agent. py`](llm-cmd-agent. py "":ignore"") that:

1. Takes a task description from the command line
2. Generates code to accomplish the task
3. Automatically extracts and executes the code
4. Passes the results back to the LLM
5. Provides a final answer or tries again if the execution fails

Here's how it works:

```bash
uv run llm-cmd-agent. py ""list all Python files under the current directory, recursively, by size""
uv run llm-cmd-agent. py ""convert the largest Markdown file to HTML""
```

The agent will:

1. Generate a shell script to list files with their sizes
2. Execute the script in a subprocess
3. Capture the output (stdout and stderr)
4. Pass the output back to the LLM for interpretation
5. Present a final answer to the user

Under the hood, the agent follows this workflow:

1. Initial prompt to generate a shell script
2. Code extraction from the LLM response
3. Code execution in a subprocess
4. Result interpretation by the LLM
5. Error handling and retry logic if needed

This demonstrates the core agent loop of:

- Planning (generating code)
- Execution (running the code)
- Reflection (interpreting results)
- Adaptation (fixing errors if needed)

### Agent Architectures

Different agent architectures exist for different use cases:

1. **ReAct** (Reasoning + Acting): Interleaves reasoning steps with actions
2. **Reflexion**: Adds self-reflection to improve reasoning
3. **MRKL** (Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language): Combines neural and symbolic modules
4. **Plan-and-Execute**: Creates a plan first, then executes steps

### Real-World Applications

LLM agents can be applied to various domains:

1. **Research assistants** that search, summarize, and synthesize information
2. **Coding assistants** that write, debug, and explain code
3. **Data analysis agents** that clean, visualize, and interpret data
4. **Customer service agents** that handle queries and perform actions
5. **Personal assistants** that manage schedules, emails, and tasks

### Project Ideas

Here are some practical agent projects you could build:

1. **Study buddy agent**: Helps create flashcards, generates practice questions, and explains concepts
2. **Job application assistant**: Searches job listings, tailors resumes, and prepares interview responses
3. **Personal finance agent**: Categorizes expenses, suggests budgets, and identifies savings opportunities
4.",https://tds.s-anand.net/#/llm-agents
llm-agents,1,4400ae4c-b52e-4fa8-9dab-cbc6c2bbefbb,llm-agents.md,"**Health and fitness coach**: Creates workout plans, tracks nutrition, and provides motivation
5. **Course project helper**: Breaks down assignments, suggests resources, and reviews work

### Best Practices

1. **Clear instructions**: Define the agent's capabilities and limitations
2. **Effective tool design**: Create tools that are specific and reliable
3. **Robust error handling**: Agents should recover gracefully from failures
4. **Memory management**: Balance context retention with token efficiency
5. **User feedback**: Allow users to correct or guide the agent

### Limitations and Challenges

Current LLM agents face several challenges:

1. **Hallucination**: Agents may generate false information or tool calls
2. **Planning limitations**: Complex tasks require better planning capabilities
3. **Tool integration complexity**: Each new tool adds implementation overhead
4. **Context window constraints**: Limited memory for long-running tasks
5. **Security concerns**: Tool access requires careful permission management.",https://tds.s-anand.net/#/llm-agents

- **CI/CD**: Integrate evals into pipelines for regression safety ([CI/CD guide](https://www. promptfoo. dev/docs/integrations/ci-cd/))

To run PromptFoo:

1. Install Node. js & npm ([nodejs. org](https://nodejs. org/))
2. Set up your [`OPENAI_API_KEY`](https://platform. openai. com/api-keys) environment variable
3. Configure `promptfooconfig. yaml`. Below is an example:

```yaml
prompts:
  - |
    Summarize this text: ""{{text}}""
  - |
    Please write a concise summary of: ""{{text}}""

providers:
  - openai:gpt-3. 5-turbo

Video screen-scraping with LLMs is a powerful technique for extracting structured data from screen recordings. This approach works with any visible screen content and bypasses traditional web scraping limitations like authentication or anti-scraping measures. [![Screen Scraping with Gemini](https://i. ytimg. com/vi_webp/2G1LqS6qO5s/sddefault. webp)](https://youtu. be/2G1LqS6qO5s)

Key benefits:

- No setup cost or authentication handling
- Works with any visible screen content
- Full control over data exposure
- Extremely cost-effective (< $0. 001 per short video)
- Bypasses anti-scraping measures
- Handles varying formats and layouts

### Quick Start Example

Here's a basic workflow using Google's AI Studio and Gemini:

1. **Record the Screen**
   - Use QuickTime (Mac) or Windows Game Bar (Windows), Screen2Gif, or any tool of your choice
   - Select specific screen area containing target data
   - Record scrolling/clicking through content
   - Keep recordings short (30-60 seconds)
2. **Process with Gemini**
   - Upload to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite. google. com/app/prompts)
   - Select Gemini 1. 5 Flash (cost-effective)
   - Prompt for structured output (JSON/CSV)

Example prompt for extracting tabular data:

```text
Turn this video into a JSON array where each item has:
{
  ""date"": ""yyyy-mm-dd"",
  ""amount"": float
}
```

### Cost Calculation

Gemini 1. 5 Flash pricing (as of January 2025):

- $0. 075 per million tokens
- Cost per frame ~ 250 tokens
- Cost for 24 hours of video at 1 frame per second ~ $1. 62!

   - Pause briefly on important data
   - Maintain consistent scroll speed
   - Use high contrast display settings
2. **Data Validation**
   - Always verify critical data manually
   - Use spot-checking for large datasets
   - Consider running multiple passes
   - Log and review any anomalies
3. **Error Handling**
   - Request data in simple formats (CSV/JSON)
   - Include validation in prompts
   - Split long videos into segments
   - Handle missing/partial data gracefully

### Use Cases

1. **Data Extraction**
   - Email content aggregation
   - Dashboard metrics collection

### Basic Usage

[Install llm](https://github. com/simonw/llm#installation). Then set up your [`OPENAI_API_KEY`](https://platform. openai. com/api-keys) environment variable. See [Getting started](https://github. com/simonw/llm?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started). **TDS Students**: See [Large Language Models](large-language-models. md) for instructions on how to get and use `OPENAI_API_KEY`. ```bash
# Run a simple prompt
llm 'five great names for a pet pelican'

# Continue a conversation
llm -c 'now do walruses'

# Start a memory-aware chat session
llm chat

# Specify a model
llm -m gpt-4. 1-nano 'Summarize tomorrow’s meeting agenda'

# Extract JSON output
llm 'List the top 5 Python viz libraries with descriptions' \
  --schema-multi 'name,description'
```

Or use llm without installation using [`uvx`](uv. md):

```bash
# Run llm via uvx without any prior installation
uvx llm 'Translate ""Hello, world"" into Japanese'

# Specify a model
uvx llm -m gpt-4. 1-nano 'Draft a 200-word blog post on data ethics'

# Use structured JSON output
uvx llm 'List the top 5 programming languages in 2025 with their release years' \
  --schema-multi 'rank,language,release_year'
```

### Key Features

marimo,0,3d91b10b-d603-41ca-bd3e-81a9c78130f6,marimo.md,"## Interactive Notebooks: Marimo

[Marimo](https://marimo. app/) is a new take on notebooks that solves some headaches of Jupyter. It runs cells reactively - when you change one cell, all dependent cells update automatically, just like a spreadsheet. Marimo's cells can't be run out of order. This makes Marimo more reproducible and easier to debug, but requires a mental shift from the Jupyter/Colab way of working. It also runs Python directly in the browser and is quite interactive. [Browse the gallery of examples](https://marimo. io/gallery). With a wide variety of interactive widgets, It's growing popular as an alternative to Streamlit for building data science web apps. Common Operations:

```python
# Create new notebook
uvx marimo new

# Run notebook server
uvx marimo edit notebook. py

# Export to HTML
uvx marimo export notebook. py
```

Best Practices:

1. **Cell Dependencies**
   - Keep cells focused and atomic
   - Use clear variable names
   - Document data flow between cells
2. **Interactive Elements**

   ```python
   # Add interactive widgets
   slider = mo. ui. slider(1, 100)
   # Create dynamic Markdown
   mo. md(f""{slider} {""🟢"" * slider. value}"")
   ```

3. **Version Control**
   - Keep notebooks are Python files
   - Use Git to track changes
   - Publish on [marimo. app](https://marimo. app/) for collaboration

multimodal-embeddings,0,5d2c63dd-4240-4fd8-9438-a9012ad9c6f1,multimodal-embeddings.md,"## Multimodal Embeddings

Multimodal embeddings map **text** and **images** into the **same** vector space, enabling direct comparison between, say, a caption — “A cute cat” — and an image of that cat. This unified representation powers real-world applications like:

- **Cross-modal search** (e. g. “find images of a sunset” via text queries)
- **Content recommendation** (suggesting visually similar products to text descriptions)
- **Clustering & retrieval** (grouping documents and their associated graphics)
- **Anomaly detection** (spotting unusual image–text pairings)

By reducing different data types to a common numeric form, you unlock richer search, enhanced recommendations, and tighter integration of visual and textual data. ## Get API keys

[Ngrok](https://ngrok. com/) is a tool that creates secure tunnels to your localhost, making your local development server accessible to the internet. It's essential for testing webhooks, sharing work in progress, or debugging applications in production-like environments. [![ngrok in 60 seconds](https://i. ytimg. com/vi_webp/dfMdLGZLXSg/sddefault. webp)](https://youtu. be/dfMdLGZLXSg)

Run the command `uvx ngrok http 8000` to create a tunnel to your local server on port 8000. This generates a public URL that you can share with others. To get started, log into `ngrok. com` and [get an authtoken from the dashboard](https://dashboard. ngrok. com/get-started/your-authtoken). Copy it. Then run:

```bash
ngrok config add-authtoken $YOUR_AUTHTOKEN
```

Now you can forward any local port to the internet. For example:

```bash
# Start a local server on port 8000
uv run -m http. server 8000

# Start HTTP tunnel
uvx ngrok http 8000
```

Here are useful things you can do with `ngrok http`:

- `ngrok http file://. ` to serve local files
- `--response-header-add ""Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *""` to enable CORS
- `--oauth google --oauth-client-id $CLIENT_ID --oauth-client-secret $SECRET --oauth-allow-domain example. com --oauth-allow-email user@example. org` to restrict users to @example. com and user@example. org using Google Auth

JSON is everywhere—APIs, logs, configuration files—and its nested or large structure can challenge memory and processing. In this tutorial, we'll explore tools to flatten, stream, and query JSON data efficiently. For example, we'll often need to process a multi-gigabyte log file from a web service where each record is a JSON object. [![JSON Parsing in Python](https://i. ytimg. com/vi/1lxrb_ezP-g/sddefault. jpg)](https://youtu. be/1lxrb_ezP-g)

This requires us to handle complex nested structures, large files that don't fit in memory, or extract specific fields. Here are the key tools and techniques for efficient JSON parsing:

| Tool                                        | Extract from JSON. . . | Why                                                               |

| [jq](#command-line-json-processing-with-jq) | JSON in the shell      | Quick data exploration and pipeline processing                    |
| [JMESPath](#jmespath-queries)               | JSON in Python         | Handle complex queries with a clean syntax                        |
| [ijson](#streaming-with-ijson)              | JSON streams in Python | Parse streaming/large JSON files memory-efficiently               |
| [Pandas](#pandas-json-columns)              | JSON columns in Python | Fast analysis of structured data                                  |
| [SQL JSON](#sql-json-functions)             | JSON in databases      | Combine structured and semi-structured data                       |
| [DuckDB](#duckdb-json-processing)           | JSON anywhere          | Fast analysis of JSON files / databases without loading to memory |

**Examples:**

- Use Pandas when you need to transform API responses into a DataFrame for further analysis. - Leverage ijson when dealing with huge JSON logs where memory is at a premium. - Apply jq for quick, iterative exploration directly in your terminal. Practice with these resources:

- [JSONPath Online Evaluator](https://jsonpath. com/): Test JSON queries
- [jq play](https://jqplay. org/): Interactive jq query testing
- [DuckDB JSON Tutorial](https://duckdb. org/docs/data/json): Learn DuckDB JSON functions

### Command-line JSON Processing with jq

[jq](https://jqlang. org/) is a versatile command-line tool for slicing, filtering, and transforming JSON. It excels in quick data exploration and can be integrated into shell scripts for automated data pipelines. **Example:** Sifting through server logs in JSON Lines format to extract error messages or aggregate metrics without launching a full-scale ETL process. ```bash
# Extract specific fields from JSONL
cat data. jsonl | jq -c 'select(. type == ""user"") | {id, name}'

# Transform JSON structure
cat data. json | jq '. items[] | {name:. name, count:. details. count}'

# Filter and aggregate
cat events. jsonl | jq -s 'group_by(. category) | map({category:. [0]. category, count: length})'
```

### JMESPath Queries

[JMESPath](https://jmespath. org/) offers a declarative query language to extract and transform data from nested JSON structures without needing verbose code. It's a neat alternative when you want to quickly pull out specific values or filter collections based on conditions. **Example:** Extracting user emails or filtering out inactive records from a complex JSON payload received from a cloud service. ```python
import jmespath

# Example queries
data = {
    ""locations"": [
        {""name"": ""Seattle"", ""state"": ""WA"", ""info"": {""population"": 737015}},
        {""name"": ""Portland"", ""state"": ""OR"", ""info"": {""population"": 652503}}
    ]
}

# Find all cities with population > 700000
cities = jmespath. search(""locations[?info. population > `700000`]. name"", data)
```

### Streaming with ijson

Loading huge JSON files all at once can quickly exhaust system memory. [ijson](https://ijson. readthedocs.",https://tds.s-anand.net/#/parsing-json
parsing-json,1,f72c14fa-8f0b-40b9-b38d-734243d96e6b,parsing-json.md,"io/en/latest/) lets you stream and process JSON incrementally. This method is ideal when your JSON file is too large or when you only need to work with part of the data. **Example:** Processing a continuous feed from an API that returns a large JSON array, such as sensor data or event logs, while filtering on the fly. ```python
import ijson

async def process_large_json(filepath: str) -> list:
    """"""Process a large JSON file without loading it entirely into memory. """"""
    results = []

    with open(filepath, 'rb') as file:
        # Stream objects under the 'items' key
        parser = ijson. items(file, 'items. item')
        async for item in parser:
            if item['value'] > 100:  # Process conditionally
                results. append(item)

    return results
```

### Pandas JSON Columns

[Pandas](https://pandas. pydata. org/) makes it easy to work with tabular data that includes JSON strings. When you receive API data where one column holds nested JSON, flattening these structures lets you analyze and visualize the data using familiar DataFrame operations. **Example:** Flattening customer records stored as nested JSON in a CSV file to extract demographic details and spending patterns. ```python
import pandas as pd

# Parse JSON strings in a column
df = pd. DataFrame({'json_col': ['{""name"": ""Alice"", ""age"": 30}', '{""name"": ""Bob"", ""age"": 25}']})
df['parsed'] = df['json_col']. apply(pd. json_normalize)

# Normalize nested JSON columns
df = pd. read_csv('data. csv')
df_normalized = pd. json_normalize(
    df['nested_json']. apply(json. loads),
    record_path=['items'],        # List of nested objects to unpack
    meta=['id', 'timestamp']      # Keep these columns from parent
)
```

### SQL JSON Functions

[SQL](https://en. wikipedia. org/wiki/SQL:2016) supports built-in JSON functions allow you to query and manipulate JSON stored within relational databases. These are implemented by most popular databases, including
[SQLite](https://www. sqlite. org/json1. html),
[PostgreSQL](https://www. postgresql. org/docs/current/functions-json. html), and
[MySQL](https://dev. mysql. com/doc/refman/8. 4/en/json-function-reference. html). This is especially handy when you have a hybrid data model, combining structured tables with semi-structured JSON columns. **Example:** An application that stores user settings or application logs as JSON in a SQLite database, enabling quick lookups and modifications without external JSON parsing libraries. ```sql
SELECT
    json_extract(data, '$. name') as name,
    json_extract(data, '$. details. age') as age
FROM users
WHERE json_extract(data, '$. active') = true
```

### DuckDB JSON Processing

[DuckDB](https://duckdb. org/) shines when analyzing JSON/JSONL files directly, making it a powerful tool for data analytics without the overhead of loading entire datasets into memory. Its SQL-like syntax simplifies exploratory analysis on nested data. **Example:** Performing ad-hoc analytics on streaming JSON logs from a web service, such as calculating average response times or aggregating user behavior metrics. ```sql
SELECT
    json_extract_string(data, '$. user. name') as name,
    avg(json_extract_float(data, '$. metrics. value')) as avg_value
FROM read_json_auto('data/*. jsonl')
GROUP BY 1
HAVING avg_value > 100

Create a virtual Teaching Assistant Discourse responder. ## Background

You are a clever student who has joined IIT Madras' Online Degree in Data Science. You have just enrolled in the [Tools in Data Science](https://tds. s-anand. net/#/2025-01/) course. Out of kindness for your teaching assistants, you have decided to build an API that can automatically answer student questions on their behalf based on:

- [Course content](https://tds. s-anand. net/#/2025-01/) with content for TDS Jan 2025 as on 15 Apr 2025. - [TDS Discourse posts](https://discourse. onlinedegree. iitm. ac. in/c/courses/tds-kb/34) with content from 1 Jan 2025 - 14 Apr 2025. ## Scrape the data

To make sure you can answer these questions, you will need to extract the data from the above source. ## Create an API

Your application exposes an API endpoint. You may host it anywhere. Let's assume it's at `https://app. example. com/api/`. The endpoint must accept a POST request, e. g. `POST https://app. example. com/api/` with a student question as well as optional base64 file attachments as JSON. For example, here's how anyone can make a request:

```bash
curl ""https://app. example. com/api/"" \
  -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" \
  -d ""{\""question\"": \""Should I use gpt-4o-mini which AI proxy supports, or gpt3. 5 turbo?\"", \""image\"": \""$(base64 -w0 project-tds-virtual-ta-q1. webp)\""}""
```

This is a [real question](https://discourse. onlinedegree. iitm. ac. in/t/ga5-question-8-clarification/155939) and uses this [screenshot](images/project-tds-virtual-ta-q1. webp):

![Screenshot](images/project-tds-virtual-ta-q1. webp)

The response must be a JSON object like this:

```json
{
  ""answer"": ""You must use `gpt-3. 5-turbo-0125`, even if the AI Proxy only supports `gpt-4o-mini`. Use the OpenAI API directly for this question. "",
  ""links"": [
    {
      ""url"": ""https://discourse. onlinedegree. iitm. ac. in/t/ga5-question-8-clarification/155939/4"",
      ""text"": ""Use the model that’s mentioned in the question. ""
    },
    {
      ""url"": ""https://discourse. onlinedegree. iitm. ac. in/t/ga5-question-8-clarification/155939/3"",
      ""text"": ""My understanding is that you just have to use a tokenizer, similar to what Prof. Anand used, to get the number of tokens and multiply that by the given rate. ""
    }
  ]
}
```

The response must be sent within 30 seconds. ## Evaluate your application

Here are a few [sample questions and evaluation parameters](project-tds-virtual-ta-promptfoo. yaml "":ignore""). These are **indicative**. The actual evaluation could ask _any_ realistic student question. To run this:

1. Edit [`project-tds-virtual-ta-promptfoo. yaml`](project-tds-virtual-ta-promptfoo. yaml "":ignore"") to replace `providers[0]. config. url` with your API URL. 2. Run this script:

   ```bash
   npx -y promptfoo eval --config project-tds-virtual-ta-promptfoo. yaml
   ```

prompt-engineering,0,ba961357-9dcd-4556-b034-a45643d7ea73,prompt-engineering.md,"## Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering is the process of crafting effective prompts for large language models (LLMs). One of the best ways to approach prompt engineering is to think of LLMs as a smart colleague (with amnesia) who needs explicit instructions. The most authoritative guides are from the LLM providers themselves:

- [Anthropic](https://docs. anthropic. com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/)
- [Google](https://cloud. google. com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/introduction-prompt-design)
- [OpenAI](https://platform. openai. com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering)

Here are some best practices:

### Use prompt optimizers

They rewrite your prompt to improve it. Explore:

- [Anthropic Prompt Optimizer](https://docs. anthropic. com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompt-improver)
- [OpenAI Prompt Generation](https://platform. openai. com/docs/guides/prompt-generation)
- [Google AI-powered prompt writing tools](https://cloud. google. com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/ai-powered-prompt-writing)

### Be clear, direct, and detailed

Be explicit and thorough. Include all necessary context, goals, and details so the model understands the full picture. - **BAD**: _Explain gravitation lensing. _ (Reason: Vague and lacks context or detail. )
- **GOOD**: _Explain the concept of gravitational lensing to a high school student who understands basic physics, including how it’s observed and its significance in astronomy. _ (Reason: Specifies the audience, scope, and focus. )

> When you ask a question, don’t be vague. Spell it out. Give every detail the listener needs. > The clearer you are, the better the answer you’ll get. > For example, don't just say, Explain Gravitation Lensing. > Say, Explain the concept of gravitational lensing to a high school student who understands basic physics, including how it’s observed and its significance in astronomy. [Anthropic](https://docs. anthropic. com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/be-clear-and-direct)

| [Google](https://cloud. google. com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/clear-instructions)

### Give examples

Provide 2-3 relevant examples to guide the model on the style, structure, or format you expect. This helps the model produce outputs consistent with your desired style. - **BAD**: _Explain how to tie a bow tie. _ (Reason: No examples or reference points given. )
- **GOOD**:
  _Explain how to tie a bow tie. For example:_

  1. _To tie a shoelace, you cross the laces and pull them tight. . . _
  2. _To tie a necktie, you place it around the collar and loop it through. . . _

  _Now, apply a similar step-by-step style to describe how to tie a bow tie. _ (Reason: Provides clear examples and a pattern to follow. )

### Think step by step

Instruct the model to reason through the problem step by step. This leads to more logical, well-structured answers. - **BAD**: _Given this transcript, is the customer satisfied?_ (Reason: No prompt for structured reasoning. )
- **GOOD**: _Given this transcript, is the customer satisfied? Think step by step. _ (Reason: Directly instructs the model to break down reasoning into steps. )

### Assign a role

Specify a role or persona for the model. This provides context and helps tailor the response style. - **BAD**: _Explain how to fix a software bug. _ (Reason: No role or perspective given. )
- **GOOD**: _You are a seasoned software engineer. Explain how to fix a software bug in legacy code, including the debugging and testing process. _ (Reason: Assigns a clear, knowledgeable persona, guiding the style and depth. )

> Tell the model who they are. Maybe they’re a seasoned software engineer fixing a legacy bug, or an experienced copy editor revising a publication. > By clearly telling the model who they are, you help them speak with just the right expertise and style. > Suddenly, your explanation sounds like it’s coming from a true specialist, not a random voice.

| [Google](https://cloud. google. com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/assign-role)

### Use XML to structure your prompt

Use XML tags to separate different parts of the prompt clearly. This helps the model understand structure and requirements. - **BAD**: _Here’s what I want: Provide a summary and then an example. _ (Reason: Unstructured, no clear separation of tasks. )
- **GOOD**:
  ```xml
  <instructions>
    Provide a summary of the concept of machine learning. </instructions>
  <example>
    Then provide a simple, concrete example of a machine learning application (e. g. , an email spam filter). </example>
  ```
  (Reason: Uses XML tags to clearly distinguish instructions from examples. )

> Think of your request like a box. XML tags are neat little labels on that box. > They help keep parts sorted, so nothing gets lost in the shuffle. [Anthropic](https://docs. anthropic. com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/use-xml-tags)

| [Google](https://cloud. google. com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/structure-prompts)

### Use Markdown to format your output

Encourage the model to use Markdown for headings, lists, code blocks, and other formatting features to produce structured, easily readable answers. - **BAD**: _Give me the steps in plain text. _ (Reason: No specific formatting instructions, less readable. )
- **GOOD**: _Provide the steps in a markdown-formatted list with ### headings for each section and numbered bullet points. _ (Reason: Directly instructs to use Markdown formatting, making output more structured and clear. )
- **BAD**: _Correct the spelling and show the corrections. _ (Reason: No specific formatting instructions)
- **GOOD**: _Correct the spelling, showing &lt;ins&gt;additions&lt;/ins&gt; and &lt;del&gt;deletions&lt;/del&gt;. _ (Reason: Directly instructs to use HTML formatting, making output more structured and clear. )

> Markdown is a simple formatting language that all models understand.",https://tds.s-anand.net/#/prompt-engineering
prompt-engineering,2,f445c9d1-a915-46e7-9e92-61da7f95f51c,prompt-engineering.md,"> You can have them add neat headings, sections, bold highlights, and bullet points. > These make complex documents more scannable and easy on the eyes. ### Use JSON for machine-readable output

When you need structured data, ask for a JSON-formatted response. This ensures the output is machine-readable and organized. - **BAD**: _Just list the items. _ (Reason: Unstructured plain text makes parsing harder. )
- **GOOD**:

  ````markdown
  Organize as an array of objects in a JSON format, like this:

  ```json
  [
    { ""name"": ""Item 1"", ""description"": ""Description of Item 1"" },
    { ""name"": ""Item 2"", ""description"": ""Description of Item 2"" },
    { ""name"": ""Item 3"", ""description"": ""Description of Item 3"" }
  ]
  ```
  ````

  (Reason: Instructing JSON format ensures structured, machine-readable output. )

Note: Always use [JSON schema](playground#attachments) if possible. [JSON schema](https://json-schema. org/) is a way to describe the structure of JSON data. An easy way to get the JSON schema is to give ChatGPT sample output and ask it to generate the schema. > Imagine you’re organizing data for a big project. Plain text is like dumping everything into one messy pile — it’s hard to find what you need later. > JSON, on the other hand, is like packing your data into neat, labeled boxes within boxes. > Everything has its place: fields like ‘name,’ ‘description,’ and ‘value’ make the data easy to read, especially for machines. > For example, instead of just listing items, you can structure them as a JSON array, with each item as an object. > That way, when you hand it to a program, it’s all clear and ready to use. ### Prefer Yes/No answers

Convert rating or percentage questions into Yes/No queries. LLMs handle binary choices better than numeric scales. - **BAD**: _On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you that this method works?_ (Reason: Asks for a numeric rating, which can be imprecise. )
- **GOOD**: _Is this method likely to work as intended? Please give a reasoning and then answer Yes or No. _ (Reason: A binary question simplifies the response and clarifies what’s being asked. )

> Don’t ask ‘On a scale of one to five. . . ’. Models are not good with numbers. > They don't know how to grade something 7 versus 8 on a 10 point scale. ‘Yes or no?’ is simple. It’s clear. It’s quick. > So, break your question into simple parts that they can answer with just a yes or a no. ### Ask for reason first, then the answer

Instruct the model to provide its reasoning steps _before_ stating the final answer. This makes it less likely to justify itself and more likely to think deeper, leading to more accurate results. - **BAD**: _What is the best route to take?_ (Reason: Direct question without prompting reasoning steps first. )
- **GOOD**: _First, explain your reasoning step by step for how you determine the best route. Then, after you’ve reasoned it out, state your final recommendation for the best route.",https://tds.s-anand.net/#/prompt-engineering
prompt-engineering,3,2b2d018d-2577-4bc2-9b78-6cce304c603b,prompt-engineering.md,"_ (Reason: Forces the model to show its reasoning process before giving the final answer. )

> BEFORE making its final choice, have the model talk through their thinking. Reasoning first, answer second. > That way, the model won't be tempted to justify an answer that they gave impulsively. It is also more likely to think deeper. ### Use proper spelling and grammar

A well-written, grammatically correct prompt clarifies expectations. Poorly structured prompts can confuse the model. - **BAD**: _xplin wht the weirless netork do? make shur to giv me a anser??_ (Reason: Poor spelling and unclear instructions. )
- **GOOD**: _Explain what a wireless network does. Please provide a detailed, step-by-step explanation. _ (Reason: Proper spelling and clarity lead to a more coherent response. )

> If your question sounds like gibberish, expect a messy answer. Speak cleanly. > When you do, the response will be much clearer. ## Video Tutorials

rag-cli,0,1b24552c-851d-4899-aa6f-605cf2b791a7,rag-cli.md,"## Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with the CLI

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) combines retrieval (searching a knowledge base) with generation (using an LLM) to produce answers grounded in your own documents. Instead of relying solely on a general-purpose LLM, RAG lets you feed it the most relevant chunks from your corpus at query time, improving accuracy, reducing hallucinations, and allowing you to answer domain‑specific questions without fine‑tuning. In particular, you can answer questions that are hard to answer with a keyword search. For example:

```bash
Q=""What does the author affectionately call the => syntax?""
# Answer: fat arrow

Q=""What lets you walk every child node of a ts. Node?""
# Answer: node. getChildren()

Q=""What are code pieces like comments and whitespace that aren’t in the AST called?""
# Answer: trivia

Q=""Which operator converts any value into an explicit boolean?""
# Answer: !!
```

You can implement RAG entirely from your terminal, without writing a single line of application code. Below is a step‑by‑step example using the TypeScript book as a data source. ### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github. com/basarat/typescript-book
cd typescript-book
```

- `--depth 1` fetches only the latest commit to minimize download size. - `cd typescript-book` moves into the project folder. You'll now be in a new folder `typescript-book` containing the repo. ### 2. Split Markdown files into chunks

```bash
(
  shopt -s globstar
  for f in **/*. md; do
    uvx --from split_markdown4gpt mdsplit4gpt ""$f"" --model gpt-4o --limit 4096 --separator ""===SPLIT==="" \
    | sed '1s/^/===SPLIT===\n/' \
    | jq -R -s -c --arg file ""$f"" '
      split(""===SPLIT==="")[1:]
      | to_entries
      | map({
          id: ($file + ""#"" + (. key | tostring)),
          content:. value
        })[]
    '
  done
) | tee chunks. json
```

- `shopt -s globstar`: lets `**/*. md` match Markdown files in all subdirectories. [bash shopt manual](https://www. gnu. org/software/bash/manual/html_node/The-Shopt-Builtin. html)
- `uvx --from split_markdown4gpt mdsplit4gpt`: [a tool](https://github. com/twardoch/split-markdown4gpt) that splits Markdown into LLM‑sized chunks:
  - `--model gpt-4o`: uses GPT‑4o token limits
  - `--limit 4096`: max tokens per chunk
  - `--separator ""===SPLIT===""`: custom split marker
- `sed '1s/^/===SPLIT===\n/'`: ensures the very first chunk starts with the separator (GNU sed manual)
- `jq -R -s -c --arg file ""$f""`: uses [jq](https://stedolan. github. io/jq/manual/) to convert chunks to JSON
  - `-R`: read raw input
  - `-s`: slurp entire input into a single string
  - `-c`: compact JSON output
  - builds an array of objects `{id, content}`, where `id` is `filename#chunkIndex`
- `tee chunks. json`: writes the resulting JSON array to `chunks. json` while printing it to stdout. You'll now have a `chunks. json` that has one `{id, content}` JSON object per line. ### 3. Generate embeddings

```bash
llm embed-multi typescript-book --model 3-small --store --format nl chunks. json
```

- `embed-multi`: computes embeddings for each entry in `chunks. json`. - `typescript-book`: a namespace or collection name for storage. - `--model 3-small`: selects the embedding model. - `--store`: save embeddings in the default backend. - `--format nl`: input is newline‑delimited JSON. [llm CLI embed-multi](https://github. com/kerenter/llm#embed-multi)

This stores the embeddings in a collection called `typescript-book`.",https://tds.s-anand.net/#/rag-cli
rag-cli,1,1e4031a4-e098-4894-8bc9-8910d70c3afd,rag-cli.md,"```bash
llm collections path  # shows where the collections are stored
llm collections delete typescript-book  # deletes the typescript-book collection
```

### 4. Find similar topics

```bash
llm similar typescript-book -n 3 -c ""What does the author affectionately call the => syntax?""
```

This returns the 3 chunksmost similar to the question posed. - `similar`: retrieves the top `n` most similar chunks from the embeddings store. - `-n 3`: return three results. - `-c`: the user’s query string. ### 5. Answer a question using retrieved context

```bash
Q=""What does the author affectionately call the => syntax?""
llm similar typescript-book -n 3 -c ""$Q"" \
  | jq '. content' \
  | llm -s ""$Q - Answer ONLY from these notes. Cite verbatim from notes. "" \
  | uvx streamdown
```

This answers the question in natural language following these steps:

1. Store the query in `Q`. 2. Retrieve the top 3 matching chunks. 3. `jq '. content'` extracts just the text snippets. 4. Pipe into `llm -s`, instructing the model:
   - `-s`: stream a prompt directly to the LLM. - `""$Q - Answer ONLY from these notes. Cite verbatim from notes. ""`: ensures the response is grounded. 5. `uvx streamdown` formats the streamed LLM output for easy reading. <!--

More questions that cannot be answered via keyword search:

Q=""Which shorthand lets you both declare and initialize a class member in one go?""
# Answer: constructor(public x:number)

Q=""What syntax allows initializing class fields outside the constructor?""
# Answer: property initializer

Q=""What property name do discriminated unions use to narrow types?""
# Answer: kind

Q=""Which keyword pauses and resumes execution in generator functions?""
# Answer: yield

Q=""What JSON-style syntax defines overloads in a callable type annotation?""
# Answer: { (foo: string): string; }

Q=""What filename do you use to declare globals available across your entire TS project?""
# Answer: global. d. ts

Q=""What TS helper wraps subclass constructors for ES5-style inheritance?""
# Answer: __extends

Q=""What option in tsconfig. json turns on ES7 decorator support?""
# Answer: experimentalDecorators

Q=""What directive in tsconfig. json preserves raw JSX output?""
# Answer: jsx: ""preserve""

Q=""In async/await, what wraps generator code to return a Promise?""
# Answer: __awaiter

Q=""What config field controls which. ts/. js files to include in compilation?""
# Answer: include / exclude

Q=""What npm package is recommended for structural deep-equality checks?""
# Answer: deep-equal

[Tools in Data Science](https://study. iitm. ac. in/ds/course_pages/BSSE2002. html) is a practical diploma level data science course at IIT Madras that teaches
popular tools for sourcing data, transforming it, analyzing it, communicating these as visual stories, and deploying them in production. <details>
<summary><strong>This course exposes you to real-life tools</strong></summary>

Courses teach you programming and data science. From statistics to algorithms to writing Python code to building models. But one critical subject that's rarely covered is: what tools should I pick and how do I become proficient in them?

These tools might not help your CV much. But they will make things easier in real life. For example, at school:

- You learn from pristine datasets. But in the industry, you'll have to scrape them yourself. - You learn how to train models. But soon, you'll just pick something from HuggingFace. - You learn to write a log parser over weeks. Instead, your boss writes a `sed` + `grep` script in minutes. [![](https://imgs. xkcd. com/comics/lisp. jpg) ""We lost the documentation on quantum mechanics. You'll have to decode the regexes yourself. ""](https://explainxkcd. com/224/)

In this course, we've curated the most important tools people use in data science. Learn them well. You'll be a **_lot_ more productive** than your peers. </details>

rest-apis,0,dbee8091-5cce-4204-9898-1cae9c80d0ff,rest-apis.md,"## REST APIs

REST (Representational State Transfer) APIs are the standard way to build web services that allow different systems to communicate over HTTP. They use standard HTTP methods and JSON for data exchange. Watch this comprehensive introduction to REST APIs (52 min):

[![REST API Crash Course - Introduction + Full Python API Tutorial (52)](https://i. ytimg. com/vi_webp/qbLc5a9jdXo/sddefault. webp)](https://youtu. be/qbLc5a9jdXo)

Key Concepts:

1. **HTTP Methods**
   - `GET`: Retrieve data
   - `POST`: Create new data
   - `PUT/PATCH`: Update existing data
   - `DELETE`: Remove data
2. **Status Codes**
   - `2xx`: Success (200 OK, 201 Created)
   - `4xx`: Client errors (400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found)
   - `5xx`: Server errors (500 Internal Server Error)

Here's a minimal REST API using FastAPI. Run this `server. py` script via `uv run server. py`:

```python
# /// script
# requires-python = "">=3. 13""
# dependencies = [
#     ""fastapi"",
#     ""uvicorn"",
# ]
# ///
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from typing import Dict, List

app = FastAPI()

# Create a list of items that will act like a database
items: List[Dict[str, float | int | str]] = []

# Create a GET endpoint that returns all items
@app. get(""/items"")
async def get_items() -> List[Dict[str, float | int | str]]:
    return items

# Create a GET endpoint that returns a specific item by ID
@app. get(""/items/{item_id}"")
async def get_item(item_id: int) -> Dict[str, float | int | str]:
    if item := next((i for i in items if i[""id""] == item_id), None):
        return item
    raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail=""Item not found"")

# Create a POST endpoint that creates a new item
@app. post(""/items"")
async def create_item(item: Dict[str, float | str]) -> Dict[str, float | int | str]:
    new_item = {""id"": len(items) + 1, ""name"": item[""name""], ""price"": float(item[""price""])}
    items. append(new_item)
    return new_item

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn. run(app, host=""0. 0. 0. 0"", port=8000)
```

Test the API with curl:

```bash
# Get all items
curl http://localhost:8000/items

# Create an item
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/items \
  -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" \
  -d '{""name"": ""Book"", ""price"": 29. 99}'

# Get specific item
curl http://localhost:8000/items/1
```

Best Practices:

1. **Use Nouns for Resources**
   - Good: `/users`, `/posts`
   - Bad: `/getUsers`, `/createPost`
2. **Version Your API**
   ```
   /api/v1/users
   /api/v2/users
   ```
3. **Handle Errors Consistently**
   ```python
   {
     ""error"": ""Not Found"",
     ""message"": ""User 123 not found"",
     ""status_code"": 404
   }
   ```
4. **Use Query Parameters for Filtering**
   ```
   /api/posts?status=published&category=tech
   ```
5. **Implement Pagination**
   ```
   /api/posts?page=2&limit=10
   ```

scheduled-scraping-with-github-actions,0,1cd21c8b-8159-4a2b-ac35-8220c44bbcfd,scheduled-scraping-with-github-actions.md,"## Scheduled Scraping with GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions provides an excellent platform for running web scrapers on a schedule. This tutorial shows how to automate data collection from websites using GitHub Actions workflows. ### Key Concepts

- **Scheduling**: Use [cron syntax](https://docs. github. com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule) to run scrapers at specific times
- **Dependencies**: Install required packages like `httpx`, `lxml`
- **Data Storage**: Save scraped data to files and commit back to the repository
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for network issues and HTML parsing
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect website terms of service and implement delays between requests

Here's a sample `scrape. py` that scrapes the IMDb Top 250 movies using httpx and lxml:

```python
import json
import httpx
from datetime import datetime, UTC
from lxml import html
from typing import List, Dict


def scrape_imdb() -> List[Dict[str, str]]:
    """"""Scrape IMDb Top 250 movies using httpx and lxml. Returns:
        List of dictionaries containing movie title, year, and rating. """"""
    headers = {""User-Agent"": ""Mozilla/5. 0 (compatible; IMDbBot/1. 0)""}
    response = httpx. get(""https://www. imdb. com/chart/top/"", headers=headers)
    response. raise_for_status()

    tree = html. fromstring(response. text)
    movies = []

    for item in tree. cssselect("". ipc-metadata-list-summary-item""):
        title = (
            item. cssselect("". ipc-title__text"")[0]. text_content()
            if item. cssselect("". ipc-title__text"")
            else None
        )
        year = (
            item. cssselect("". cli-title-metadata span"")[0]. text_content()
            if item. cssselect("". cli-title-metadata span"")
            else None
        )
        rating = (
            item. cssselect("". ipc-rating-star"")[0]. text_content()
            if item. cssselect("". ipc-rating-star"")
            else None
        )

        if title and year and rating:
            movies. append({""title"": title, ""year"": year, ""rating"": rating})

    return movies


# Scrape data and save with timestamp
now = datetime. now(UTC)
with open(f'imdb-top250-{now. strftime(""%Y-%m-%d"")}. json', ""a"") as f:
    f. write(json. dumps({""timestamp"": now. isoformat(), ""movies"": scrape_imdb()}) + ""\n"")
```

Here's a sample `. github/workflows/imdb-top250. yml` that runs the scraper daily and saves the data:

```yaml
name: Scrape IMDb Top 250

on:
  schedule:
    # Runs at 00:00 UTC every day
    - cron: ""0 0 * * *""
  workflow_dispatch: # Allow manual triggers

jobs:
  scrape-imdb:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install uv
        uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v5

      - name: Run scraper
        run: | # python
          uv run --with httpx,lxml,cssselect python scrape. py

      - name: Commit and push changes
        run: |
          git config --local user. email ""github-actions[bot]@users. noreply. github. com""
          git config --local user. name ""github-actions[bot]""
          git add *. json
          git commit -m ""Update IMDb Top 250 data [skip ci]"" || exit 0
          git push
```

### Best Practices

1. **Cache Dependencies**: Use GitHub's caching to speed up package installation
2. **Handle Errors**: Implement retries and error logging
3. **Rate Limiting**: Add delays between requests to avoid overwhelming servers
4. **Data Validation**: Verify scraped data structure before saving
5. **Monitoring**: Set up notifications for workflow failures

sqlite,0,6a3f4383-a0c1-4393-b3fb-64fd1ba43b0d,sqlite.md,"## Database: SQLite

Relational databases are used to store data in a structured way. You'll often access databases created by others for analysis. PostgreSQL, MySQL, MS SQL, Oracle, etc. are popular databases. But the most installed database is [SQLite](https://www. sqlite. org/index. html). It's embedded into many devices and apps (e. g. your phone, browser, etc. ). It's lightweight but very scalable and powerful. Watch these introductory videos to understand SQLite and how it's used in Python (34 min):

[![SQLite Introduction - Beginners Guide to SQL and Databases (22 min)](https://i. ytimg. com/vi_webp/8Xyn8R9eKB8/sddefault. webp)](https://youtu. be/8Xyn8R9eKB8)

[![SQLite Backend for Beginners - Create Quick Databases with Python and SQL (13 min)](https://i. ytimg. com/vi_webp/Ohj-CqALrwk/sddefault. webp)](https://youtu. be/Ohj-CqALrwk)

There are many non-relational databases (NoSQL) like [ElasticSearch](https://www. elastic. co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index. html), [MongoDB](https://www. mongodb. com/docs/manual/), [Redis](https://redis. io/docs/latest/), etc. that you should know about and we may cover later. Core Concepts:

```sql
-- Create a table
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    email TEXT UNIQUE,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Insert data
INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES
    ('Alice', 'alice@example. com'),
    ('Bob', 'bob@example. com');

-- Query data
SELECT name, COUNT(*) as count
FROM users
GROUP BY name
HAVING count > 1;

-- Join tables
SELECT u. name, o. product
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN orders o ON u. id = o. user_id
WHERE o. status = 'pending';
```

Python Integration:

```python
import sqlite3
from pathlib import Path
import pandas as pd

async def query_database(db_path: Path, query: str) -> pd. DataFrame:
    """"""Execute SQL query and return results as DataFrame. Args:
        db_path: Path to SQLite database
        query: SQL query to execute

    Returns:
        DataFrame with query results
    """"""
    try:
        conn = sqlite3. connect(db_path)
        return pd. read_sql_query(query, conn)
    finally:
        conn. close()

# Example usage
db = Path('data. db')
df = await query_database(db, '''
    SELECT date, COUNT(*) as count
    FROM events
    GROUP BY date
''')
```

Common Operations:

1. **Database Management**

   ```sql
   -- Backup database. backup 'backup. db'

   -- Import CSV. mode csv. import data. csv table_name

   -- Export results. headers on. mode csv. output results. csv
   SELECT * FROM table;
   ```

2. **Performance Optimization**

   ```sql
   -- Create index
   CREATE INDEX idx_user_email ON users(email);

   -- Analyze query
   EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN
   SELECT * FROM users WHERE email LIKE '%@example. com';

   -- Show indexes
   SELECT * FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='index';
   ```

3. **Data Analysis**

   ```sql
   -- Time series aggregation
   SELECT
       date(timestamp),
       COUNT(*) as events,
       AVG(duration) as avg_duration
   FROM events
   GROUP BY date(timestamp);

   -- Window functions
   SELECT *,
       AVG(amount) OVER (
           PARTITION BY user_id
           ORDER BY date
           ROWS BETWEEN 3 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
       ) as moving_avg
   FROM transactions;
   ```

### Image Processing with PIL (Pillow)

[![Python Tutorial: Image Manipulation with Pillow (16 min)](https://i. ytimg. com/vi_webp/6Qs3wObeWwc/sddefault. webp)](https://youtu. be/6Qs3wObeWwc)

[Pillow](https://python-pillow. org/) is Python's leading library for image processing, offering powerful tools for editing, analyzing, and generating images. It handles various formats (PNG, JPEG, GIF, etc. ) and provides operations from basic resizing to complex filters. Here's a minimal example showing common operations:

```python
# /// script
# requires-python = "">=3. 11""
# dependencies = [""Pillow""]
# ///

from PIL import Image, ImageEnhance, ImageFilter

async def process_image(path: str) -> Image. Image:
    """"""Process an image with basic enhancements. """"""
    with Image. open(path) as img:
        # Convert to RGB to ensure compatibility
        img = img. convert('RGB')

        # Resize maintaining aspect ratio
        img. thumbnail((800, 800))

        # Apply enhancements
        img = (ImageEnhance. Contrast(img). enhance(1. 2))

        return img. filter(ImageFilter. SHARPEN)

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    import asyncio
    img = asyncio. run(process_image(""input. jpg""))
    img. save(""output. jpg"", quality=85)
```

Key features and techniques you'll learn:

- **Image Loading and Saving**: Handle various formats with automatic conversion
- **Basic Operations**: Resize, rotate, crop, and flip images
- **Color Manipulation**: Adjust brightness, contrast, and color balance
- **Filters and Effects**: Apply blur, sharpen, and other visual effects
- **Drawing**: Add text, shapes, and overlays to images
- **Batch Processing**: Handle multiple images efficiently
- **Memory Management**: Process large images without memory issues

### Basic Image Operations

Common operations for resizing, cropping, and rotating images:

```python
from PIL import Image

async def transform_image(
    path: str,
    size: tuple[int, int],
    rotation: float = 0
) -> Image. Image:
    """"""Transform image with basic operations. """"""
    with Image. open(path) as img:
        # Resize with anti-aliasing
        img = img. resize(size, Image. LANCZOS)

        # Rotate around center
        if rotation:
            img = img. rotate(rotation, expand=True)

        # Auto-crop empty edges
        img = img. crop(img. getbbox())

        return img
```

### Color and Enhancement

Adjust image appearance with built-in enhancement tools:

```python
from PIL import ImageEnhance, ImageOps

async def enhance_image(
    img: Image. Image,
    brightness: float = 1. 0,
    contrast: float = 1. 0,
    saturation: float = 1. 0
) -> Image. Image:
    """"""Apply color enhancements to image. """"""
    enhancers = [
        (ImageEnhance. Brightness, brightness),
        (ImageEnhance. Contrast, contrast),
        (ImageEnhance. Color, saturation)
    ]

    for Enhancer, factor in enhancers:
        if factor != 1. 0:
            img = Enhancer(img). enhance(factor)

    return img
```

### Filters and Effects

Apply visual effects and filters to images:

```python
from PIL import ImageFilter

def apply_effects(img: Image. Image) -> Image. Image:
    """"""Apply various filters and effects. """"""
    effects = {
        'blur': ImageFilter. GaussianBlur(radius=2),
        'sharpen': ImageFilter. SHARPEN,
        'edge': ImageFilter. FIND_EDGES,
        'emboss': ImageFilter. EMBOSS
    }

    return {name: img. filter(effect)
            for name, effect in effects. items()}
```

### Drawing and Text

Add text, shapes, and overlays to images:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw, ImageFont

async def add_watermark(
    img: Image. Image,
    text: str,
    font_size: int = 30
) -> Image. Image:
    """"""Add text watermark to image. """"""
    draw = ImageDraw. Draw(img)
    font = ImageFont. truetype(""arial. ttf"", font_size)

    # Calculate text size and position
    text_bbox = draw.",https://tds.s-anand.net/#/transforming-images

    text_width = text_bbox[2] - text_bbox[0]
    text_height = text_bbox[3] - text_bbox[1]

    # Position text at bottom-right
    x = img. width - text_width - 10
    y = img. height - text_height - 10

    # Add text with shadow
    draw. text((x+2, y+2), text, font=font, fill='black')
    draw. text((x, y), text, font=font, fill='white')

    return img
```

### Memory-Efficient Processing

Handle large images without loading them entirely into memory:

```python
from PIL import Image
import os

async def process_large_images(
    input_dir: str,
    output_dir: str,
    max_size: tuple[int, int]
) -> None:
    """"""Process multiple large images efficiently. """"""
    os. makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)

    for filename in os. listdir(input_dir):
        if not filename. lower(). endswith(('. png', '. jpg', '. jpeg')):
            continue

        input_path = os. path. join(input_dir, filename)
        output_path = os. path. join(output_dir, filename)

        with Image. open(input_path) as img:
            # Process in chunks using thumbnail
            img. thumbnail(max_size)
            img. save(output_path, optimize=True)
```

unicode,0,8c38318f-ec2f-48ef-8eaa-b401badf9dc8,unicode.md,"## Unicode

Ever noticed when you copy-paste some text and get garbage symbols? Or see garbage when you load a CSV file? This video explains why. It covers how computers store text (called character encoding) and why it sometimes goes wonky. Learn about ASCII (the original 7-bit encoding system that could only handle 128 characters), why that wasn't enough for global languages, and how modern solutions like Unicode save the day by letting us use any character from any language. Some programs try to guess encodings (sometimes badly!). A signature called BOM (Byte Order Mark)helps computers know exactly how to read text files correctly. Learn how Unicode, UTF-8 and character encoding works. This is a common gotcha when building apps that handle international text - something bootcamps often skip but developers and data scientists regularly face in the real world. Unicode is fundamental for data scientists working with international data. Here are key concepts you need to understand:

- **Character Encodings**: Different ways to represent text in computers
  - ASCII (7-bit): Limited to 128 characters, English-only
  - UTF-8: Variable-width encoding, backwards compatible with ASCII
  - UTF-16: Fixed-width encoding, used in Windows and Java
  - UTF-32: Fixed-width encoding, memory inefficient but simple

Common encoding issues you'll encounter:

```python
# Reading files with explicit encoding
with open('file. txt', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    text = f. read()

# Handling encoding errors
import pandas as pd
df = pd. read_csv('data. csv', encoding='utf-8', errors='replace')

# Detecting file encoding
import chardet
with open('unknown. txt', 'rb') as f:
    result = chardet. detect(f. read())
print(result['encoding'])
```

uv,0,a0099b12-b17c-4b77-9f8a-b2ed7ee9c72f,uv.md,"## Python tools: uv

[Install uv](https://docs. astral. sh/uv/getting-started/installation/). [`uv`](https://docs. astral. sh/uv/) is a fast Python package and project manager that's becoming the standard for running Python scripts. It replaces tools like pip, conda, pipx, poetry, pyenv, twine, and virtualenv into one, enabling:

- **Python Version Management**: uv installs and manages _multiple_ Python versions, allowing developers to specify and switch between versions seamlessly. - **Virtual Environment Handling**: It automates the creation and management of virtual environments, ensuring isolated and consistent development spaces for different projects. - **Dependency Management**: With support for the pyproject. toml format, uv enables precise specification of project dependencies. It maintains a universal lockfile, uv. lock, to ensure reproducible installations across different systems. - **Project Execution**: The `uv run` command allows for the execution of scripts and applications within the managed environment, streamlining development workflows. Here are some commonly used commands:

```bash
# Replace python with uv. This automatically installs Python and dependencies. uv run script. py

# Run a Python script directly from the Internet
uv run https://example. com/script. py

# Run a Python script without installing
uvx ruff

# Use a specific Python version
uv run --python 3. 11 script. py

# Add dependencies to your script
uv add httpx --script script. py

# Create a virtual environment at. venv
uv venv

# Install packages to your virtual environment
uv pip install httpx
```

Here are some useful tools you can run with `uvx` without installation:

```bash
uvx --from jupyterlab jupyter-lab   # Jupyter notebook
uvx marimo      # Interactive notebook
uvx llm         # Chat with LLMs from the command line
uvx openwebui   # Chat with LLMs via the browser
uvx httpie      # Make HTTP requests
uvx datasette   # Browse SQLite databases
uvx markitdown  # Convert PDF to Markdown
uvx yt-dlp      # Download YouTube videos
uvx asciinema   # Record your terminal and play it
```

uv uses [inline script metadata](https://packaging. python. org/en/latest/specifications/inline-script-metadata/#inline-script-metadata) for dependencies. The eliminates the need for `requirements. txt` or virtual environments. For example:

```python
# /// script
# requires-python = "">=3. 11""
# dependencies = [
#   ""httpx"",
#   ""pandas"",
# ]
# ///
```

vector-databases,0,07b9c21b-ffbc-4858-b76c-37efd3bc0a2c,vector-databases.md,"## Vector Databases

Vector databases are specialized databases that store and search vector embeddings efficiently. Use vector databases when your embeddings exceed available memory or when you want it run fast at scale. (This is important. If your code runs fast and fits in memory, you **DON'T** need a vector database. You can can use `numpy` for these tasks. )

Vector databases are an evolving space. The first generation of vector databases were written in C and typically used an algorithm called [HNSW](https://en. wikipedia. org/wiki/Hierarchical_navigable_small_world) (a way to approximately find the nearest neighbor). Some popular ones are:

- **[chroma 19,637 ⭐ May 2025](https://github. com/chroma-core/chroma)**
- **[qdrant 23,341 ⭐ May 2025](https://github. com/qdrant/qdrant)**
- **[lancedb 6,327 ⭐ May 2025](https://github. com/lancedb/lancedb)**

- **[weaviate 13,222 ⭐ May 2025](https://github. com/weaviate/weaviate)**

In addition, most relational databases now support vector search. For example:

- **[DuckDB](https://duckdb. org/)**: Supports vector search with [`vss`](https://duckdb. org/docs/extensions/vss. html). - **[SQLite](https://www. sqlite. org/)**: Supports vector search with [`sqlite-vec`](https://github. com/asg017/sqlite-vec). - **[PostgreSQL](https://www. postgresql. org/)**: Supports vector search with [`pgvector`](https://github. com/pgvector/pgvector).

vercel,0,d3e15166-b6cd-4721-9eff-6e187c531444,vercel.md,"## Serverless hosting: Vercel

<!--

Why Vercel? I evaluated from https://survey. stackoverflow. co/2024/technology#2-cloud-platforms

- AWS, Azure, Google Cloud are too complex for beginners
- Cloudflare (next most popular, widely admired) Python support is in beta
- Hetzner (most admired), Supabase (next most admired) do not have a serverless platform
- Fly. io (next most admired) does not have a free tier
- Heroku (used in previous terms) is the least admired
- Vercel is both popular, admired, growing, has a free plan, and a simple API

-->

Serverless platforms let you rent a single function instead of an entire machine. They're perfect for small web tools that _don't need to run all the time_. Here are some common real-life uses:

- A contact form that emails you when someone wants to hire you (runs for 2-3 seconds, a few times per day)
- A tool that converts uploaded photos to black and white (runs for 5-10 seconds when someone uploads a photo)
- A chatbot that answers basic questions about your business hours (runs for 1-2 seconds per question)
- A newsletter sign-up that adds emails to your mailing list (runs for 1 second per sign-up)
- A webhook that posts your Etsy sales to Discord (runs for 1 second whenever you make a sale)

You only pay when someone uses your tool, and the platform automatically handles busy periods. For example, if 100 people fill out your contact form at once, the platform creates 100 temporary copies of your code to handle them all. When they're done, these copies disappear. It's cheaper than running a full-time server because you're not paying for the time when no one is using your tool - most tools are idle 95% of the time!

Rather than writing a full program, serverless platforms let you write functions. These functions are called via HTTP requests. They run in a cloud environment and are scaled up and down automatically. But this means you write programs in a different style. For example:

- You can't `pip install` packages - you have to use `requirements. txt`
- You can't read or write files from the file system - you can only use APIs. - You can't run commands (e. g. `subprocess. run()`)

[Vercel](https://vercel. com/) is a cloud platform optimized for frontend frameworks and serverless functions. Vercel is tightly integrated with GitHub. Pushing to your repository automatically triggers new deployments. Here's a [quickstart](https://vercel. com/docs/functions/runtimes/python). [Sign-up with Vercel](https://vercel. com/signup). Create an empty `git` repo with this `api/index. py` file. To deploy a FastAPI app, add a `requirements. txt` file with `fastapi` as a dependency. ```text
fastapi
```

Add your FastAPI code to a file, e. g. `main. py`. ```python
# main. py
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app. get(""/"")
def read_root():
    return {""message"": ""Hello, World!""}
```

Add a `vercel. json` file to the root of your repository. ```json
{
  ""builds"": [{ ""src"": ""main. py"", ""use"": ""@vercel/python"" }],
  ""routes"": [{ ""src"": ""/(. *)"", ""dest"": ""main.",https://tds.s-anand.net/#/vercel
vercel,1,67542c75-4a0f-458a-9780-f976c32b887d,vercel.md,"py"" }]
}
```

On the command line, run:

- `npx vercel` to deploy a test version
- `npx vercel --prod` to deploy to production

**Environment Variables**. Use `npx vercel env add` to add environment variables. In your code, use `os. environ. get('SECRET_KEY')` to access them. ### Videos

You'll learn how to use LLMs to interpret images and extract useful information, covering:

- **Setting Up Vision Models**: Integrate vision capabilities with LLMs using APIs like OpenAI's Chat Completion. - **Sending Image URLs for Analysis**: Pass URLs or base64-encoded images to LLMs for processing. - **Reading Image Responses**: Get detailed textual descriptions of images, from scenic landscapes to specific objects like cricketers or bank statements. - **Extracting Data from Images**: Convert extracted image data to various formats like Markdown tables or JSON arrays. - **Handling Model Hallucinations**: Address inaccuracies in extraction results, understanding how different prompts can affect output quality. - **Cost Management for Vision Models**: Adjust detail settings (e. g. , ""detail: low"") to balance cost and output precision.

- [Sample images used](https://drive. google. com/drive/folders/14MFc7XmGIUDU4-vbmF9305c1SSQrM-gR)

Here is an example of how to analyze an image using the OpenAI API. ```bash
curl https://api. openai. com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" \
  -H ""Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY"" \

          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }'
```

Let's break down the request:

- `curl https://api. openai. com/v1/chat/completions`: The API endpoint for text generation. - `-H ""Content-Type: application/json""`: The content type of the request. - `-H ""Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY""`: The API key for authentication. - `-d`: The request body. - `""model"": ""gpt-4o-mini""`: The model to use for text generation. - `""messages"":`: The messages to send to the model. - `""role"": ""user""`: The role of the message. - `""content"":`: The content of the message. - `{""type"": ""text"", ""text"": ""What is in this image?""}`: The text message. - `{""type"": ""image_url""}`: The image message. - `""detail"": ""low""`: The detail level of the image. `low` uses fewer tokens at lower detail. `high` uses more tokens for higher detail. - `""image_url"": {""url"": ""https://upload. wikimedia. org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Correlation_coefficient. png""}`: The URL of the image. You can send images in a [base64 encoded format](base64-image. md), too. For example:

```bash
# Download image and convert to base64 in one step
IMAGE_BASE64=$(curl -s ""https://upload. wikimedia. org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Correlation_coefficient. png"" | base64 -w 0)

# Send to OpenAI API

According to the [2024 StackOverflow Survey](https://survey. stackoverflow. co/2024/technology/#1-integrated-development-environment) almost 75% of developers use it. We recommend you learn it well. Even if you use another editor, you'll be working with others who use it, and it's a good idea to have some exposure.

Scrape JavaScript‑heavy sites effortlessly with Playwright. [![🤖 Playwright: Advanced Web Scraping in Python (14 min)](https://i. ytimg. com/vi_webp/biFzRHk4xpY/sddefault. webp)](https://youtu. be/biFzRHk4xpY) ([youtube. com](https://www. youtube. com/watch?v=biFzRHk4xpY&utm_source=chatgpt. com))

Playwright offers:

- **JavaScript rendering**: Executes page scripts so you scrape only after content appears. ([playwright. dev](https://playwright. dev/python/docs/intro))
- **Headless & headed modes**: Run without UI or in a real browser for debugging. ([playwright. dev](https://playwright. dev/python/docs/intro))
- **Auto‑waiting & retry**: Built‑in locators reduce flakiness. ([playwright. dev](https://playwright. dev/python/docs/locators))
- **Multi‑browser support**: Chromium, Firefox, WebKit—all from one API. ([playwright. dev](https://playwright. dev/python/docs/intro))

### Example: Scraping a JS‑Rendered Site

We’ll scrape [Quotes to Scrape (JS)](https://quotes. toscrape. com/js/)—a site that loads quotes via JavaScript, so a simple `requests` call gets only an empty shell ([quotes. toscrape. com](https://quotes. toscrape. com/js/)). Playwright runs the scripts and gives us the real content:

```python
# /// script
# dependencies = [""playwright""]
# ///

from playwright. sync_api import sync_playwright

def scrape_quotes():
    with sync_playwright() as p:
        # Channel can be ""chrome"", ""msedge"", ""chrome-beta"", ""msedge-beta"" or ""msedge-dev"". browser = p. chromium. launch(headless=True, channel=""chrome"")
        page = browser. new_page()
        page. goto(""https://quotes. toscrape. com/js/"")
        quotes = page. query_selector_all("". quote"")
        for q in quotes:
            text = q. query_selector("". text""). inner_text()
            author = q. query_selector("". author""). inner_text()
            print(f""{text} — {author}"")
        browser. close()

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    scrape_quotes()
```

Save as `scraper. py` and run:

```bash
uv run scraper. py
```

You’ll see each quote plus author printed—fetched only after the JS executes. .",https://tds.s-anand.net/#/web-automation-with-playwright

[![Wikipedia data with Wikimedia Python library](https://i. ytimg. com/vi_webp/b6puvm-QEY0/sddefault. webp)](https://youtu. be/b6puvm-QEY0)

You'll learn how to scrape data from Wikipedia using the `wikipedia` Python library, covering:

- **Installing and Importing**: Use pip install to get the Wikipedia library and import it with import wikipedia as wk. - **Keyword Search**: Use the search function to find Wikipedia pages containing a specific keyword, limiting results with the results argument. - **Fetching Summaries**: Use the summary function to get a concise summary of a Wikipedia page, limiting sentences with the sentences argument. - **Retrieving Full Pages**: Use the page function to obtain the full content of a Wikipedia page, including sections and references. - **Accessing URLs**: Retrieve the URL of a Wikipedia page using the url attribute of the page object. - **Extracting References**: Use the references attribute to get all reference links from a Wikipedia page. - **Fetching Images**: Access all images on a Wikipedia page via the images attribute, which returns a list of image URLs. - **Extracting Tables**: Use the pandas. read_html function to extract tables from the HTML content of a Wikipedia page, being mindful of table indices. Here are links and references:
