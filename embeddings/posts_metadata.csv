Hi Nilay,
In order to make a api call to openai chat completions you are required to send authentication information(openai key) in headers. For first question of GA3 you don’t have to send actual(working) api key, any dummy api key would work(you can put your name, or tds anything works)

i have a doubt, while submitting the GA3, both 7th and 8th questions require the API url to be active and connected right, but its not possible as both the URLs use same port, so if we check my 7th question URL is running right now, it’ll show as correct, but then if i  run 8th question URL, the 7th question will automatically show the error,
is there any solution to this problem?

Your scores are evaluated on a site that is external to the seek portal and is not integrated with the seek portal. Therefore seek does not know if you have submitted or not and by default says that it has not been submitted because it cannot see your external evaluation. There will not be a fix for this for some time. Scores for GA1, GA2, GA3, GA4, GA5, Project1, Project2, ROE will NOT be inside your seek portal. The scores will only be visible in the dashboard. Just ignore anything inside seek portal. The dashboard is where all your subject score cards exists. As stated in multiple places on discourse as well as in live sessions, The final score is always your last submission. If your dashboard score does not match your final submission score on the assignment page, only then contact us regarding your marks. Kind regards

For question 16 of GA1, It says ""Rename all files replacing each digit with the next ""
Accepted answer is working only if file names are renamed as
2h3q9x. txt → 3h4q0x. txt
eb209nmlca. txt → eb310nmlca. txt
That means if digit is 9 then next digit should be 0. @carlton

Hi manmeet,
I don’t know about solution to this. Some network setting might be causing problem. Alternatively you can make use of GitHub codespaces which provides 120 hours of free run time in a month. With GitHub codespaces you can use Ubuntu os, and visually it gives you feel of vs code. You can also active your GitHub student developer pack and get 180 hours of GitHub codespaces and some more benefits such as cloud resources and domains. I have done all questions of week1 and week2 on codespaces only, codespaces works very well if you have good internet connection. -------------------

Hello Sir,
I understand that we can deploy on vercel. Can it be deployed on Heroku as well? I believe both serve the same purpose. Wanted to know your thoughts on the same sir. Thanks and Regards

Who were evaluated? How did we decide what to evaluate?
All the image ids we evaluated were what
you
submitted to us. This is the list of docker repos that was given to us by
@s. anand
as the official list that met all the pre-requisites of Project 1. Therefore we will only evaluate those on this list who are eligible for evaluation with the repos
you
gave us. For clarity. Your docker repo gets a unique id every time it is changed. We will ONLY evaluate the image id which was present at the time of the docker repo being pulled. This acts as a time stamped frozen version of your repo. No other image id will be evaluated. How to fix bugs in our scripts
Create Pull requests to

If your Docker image was run on the wrong architecture, please fill out this form:

Bug fixes
If you find bugs in our evaluation scripts, you might benefit from more marks because of the bug fix. So it is in your interest to look through our scripts and logs and identify bugs or anomalies. You might just go from 0 to heros. Kind regards,

Greetings sir!
Sir, I have a query about the criteria for earning bonus marks in the TDS course. I’ve noticed that some students who completed GA7 are receiving bonus marks for extra peer reviews (5 bonus marks is quite significant as it improves grades as well). However, what about those of us who completed all 6 assignments but missed GA7 for some reason?
As the course is quite challenging due to the vast syllabus, bonus marks would be really helpful for many of us. Could you kindly clarify the situation?
Thank you and Regards

There seems to be a sudden and unannounced change in the GA marking scheme, which feels quite arbitrary. Initially, we were told that GA would carry 15% weight, calculated as the best 4 out of 7. Based on this, after scoring full marks in four GAs, I didn’t attempt the rest. Even then, I did complete GA5 and GA6, which you can verify. Now I’m seeing in groups that there’s an “extra benefit” being given for GA7. If any changes are being made to the evaluation criteria, they should be communicated clearly via email or discourse. Transparency is important, and as students, we have the right to be informed about such decisions in advance. I could point out several other issues, but to keep it brief — grading should be fair and consistent. Every student deserves an equal opportunity, and if GA7 is being considered differently, everyone should have the chance to attempt or review it accordingly. @carlton

Sir,
I hope you are well
According to the grading document, we were told that only the best 4 out of the 7 assessments would count towards our final grade. There was no mention of any bonus marks, and we were not informed about the +5 bonus marks for GA7 before the deadline. Because of other academic commitments like Project 2, some of us couldn’t complete GA7. Recently, we found out that some students received an email saying they’ve been given +5 bonus marks for GA7, which directly affects their final score and possibly their overall grade. Since this information wasn’t shared earlier, we kindly request you to consider offering an alternative way for those who missed GA7 to earn the bonus marks. This could be through a submission review or another form of assessment. We genuinely hope for your understanding and would be very grateful if you could provide a chance for us to earn the bonus marks too. Best regards,
Palaash V. Upadhyay

Transparency is important, and as students, we have the right to be informed about such decisions in advance.",https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/bonus-marks-in-tds-for-jan-25/172246,forum/content/3,25

Yes sir , we have completed all the previous ga but not able to do week 7  , we feel that the bonus should be given to all on the basis of ga and not only on week 7. Or it should have been informed earlier if such bonus was to be given. Please do consider our request. Thank you

The sudden introduction of bonus marks for GA7 in Tools in Data Science has left many students confused, as there was no prior intimation regarding this change. We had all planned our submissions based on the clearly communicated “best 4 out of 7” policy. This unexpected shift has raised concerns about transparency and fairness principles that should be central to academic assessment. Fairness is not a privilege to be selectively granted; it is a fundamental right for every student. We respectfully urge the course coordinators to offer clarification and ensure that all students are evaluated on an equal footing. We hope the final grading reflects both justice and academic integrity. -------------------

Yes Sir, I also completed 6 GAs even tho it was written only best 4 out of 7 GAs would be considered for final grade, but couldn’t complete GA 7 due to pressure of other subjects, if it was written in the grading document I would have done it, hoping you would understand Sir, Please do consider our request.

sir in the grading document it was mentioned best 4 out of 7 assignments but I did 6 GAs but skipped GA7 due to other assignments and projects but now we got to know that 5 bonus marks are given in ga 7 which seems unfair to all of us as mostly people who did GA7 are the one who were not able to complete previous GAs so giving bonus for the last day give them a edge
If it was announced before deadline of GA 7 it was okay and good for us to improve our grade but now it seems quite unfair so, please come with the best possible solution for this
Thanking you

I have similar concern
For Q1, I used the following code:
print(f'Pearson correlation for Karnataka between price retention and column')
kk = df[df['State'] == 'Karnataka']
for col in ['Mileage (km/l)', 'Avg Daily Distance (km)', 'Engine Capacity (cc)']:
    pearson_corr = kk['price_retention']. corr(kk[col])
    print(f'\t{col:25} : {pearson_corr:. 2f}')
And got the following output:
Pearson correlation for Karnataka between price retention and column
	Mileage (km/l)            : 0. 03
	Avg Daily Distance (km)   : -0. 06
	Engine Capacity (cc)      : -0. 04
Whereas options are below where none of them are correct. image

Whereas for Q2 (Punjab and Yamaha) I used the following code:
print(f'Pearson correlation for Punjab and Yamaha between price retention and column')
pb = df[(df['State'] == 'Punjab') & (df['Brand'] == 'Yamaha')]
for col in ['Mileage (km/l)', 'Avg Daily Distance (km)', 'Engine Capacity (cc)']:
    pearson_corr = pb['price_retention']. corr(pb[col])
    print(f'\t{col:25} : {pearson_corr:. 2f}')
and got the following answers:
Pearson correlation for Punjab and Yamaha between price retention and column
	Mileage (km/l)            : 0. 24
	Avg Daily Distance (km)   : -0. 06
	Engine Capacity (cc)      : -0. 08
The options for Q2 are given below and 2 of them are correct (AvgDistance and Mileage). image

Dear TDS Team,
There are multiple issues in Graded Assignment 6 that require urgent attention:
Questions 1 and 2, along with their options, are ambiguous. In Questions 3 and 4, I am unable to obtain an exact answer that matches any of the given options, despite trying multiple approaches, including the Excel regression method and other models in a Google Colab file. The data for Question 10 is missing. I attempted to run the shapefile in QGIS, but it resulted in an error. Additionally, I searched for the shapefile of New York roads on official websites, but their servers are currently under maintenance. The assignment deadline is approaching, but these issues remain unresolved. Kindly look into this matter at the earliest and provide a resolution as soon as possible. Thank you for your support. -------------------

My question 7 for GA6 is :
A wildfire is threatening a rural mountain region, and emergency services need to coordinate evacuation routes for four remote communities. The Emergency Management Center is located at a central command post, and must plan the most efficient evacuation route to ensure rapid and safe community evacuation. The four communities are: Silver Springs Community : (42. 1029,-85. 665) ;Pleasant Harbor Community : (42. 1238,-85. 9043);Summit Shores Village : (42. 0415,-85. 8696);River Retreat Outpost : (42. 0417,-85. 6836) & Central Command Post Location: (42. 0587,-85. 7226) Using the Haversine package, calculate the distance from the Central Command Post to Silver Springs Community. Which of the following is the MOST ACCURATE distance
Whose options provided are :
10418 meters
12287 meters
10965 meters
11149 meters
However, after trying all methods out there my distance comes out to be 6873 meters, I selected 10418 as the answer (closest approximation to 6873 meters)
I assume that the question must have been central command post to summit shores village (whose answer turns out to be 12287 meters)
Kindly look into the question, and let me know about the same (the destination from central command post)

Hi
@carlton
sir,
I have received the bonus marks email with 5 additional HTML files for peer review. However, I noticed that one of these files was also included in the initial peer grading email. Could you please clarify if I should fill out the peer review form for this particular file again, or should I skip it since it has already been graded?

“Students are allowed to take help from their pets in completing assignments. ”
So I did. Confession: My Labrador Did All My Assignments
Yes, I got
great marks
in Assignments, ROEs, and Project 1. But let’s be real…
It was
my Labrador
who did the actual work
While I was snoozing through deadlines, he was:
Solving
deployment issues
faster than my dev server boots
Writing
function calling code
like a true GPT whisperer
Fixing
LLM bugs
that I didn’t even understand
Meanwhile, I was just vibing in my blanket. He growled at broken APIs. I took the credit. Message from the Dog Developer:
“Thank you all for an awesome semester!
I learned more than some juniors. From containerization to prompt tuning. But I am
personally offended
by one thing…”
“How dare you give
bonus marks on Week 7
?
I skipped it — just like many — because we were told
only best 4 of 7 would count. I demand justice. And a belly rub. ”
–
, Full-stack Labrador & Part-time Therapist
Moral of the story:
Let your pets help with your coursework. You get the grade. They get the rage. -------------------

With just 5 days left, I wanted to ask for a quick suggestion. I’m prioritizing PYQs for sure, but between revisiting lectures and attending TA sessions (both quite time-consuming), which one would you recommend focusing on for better returns?
Also, if possible, could you please point out the top 2–3 most important topics—maybe things like LLM, Data Sourcing, etc. —to give more attention to?

I recommend attending the Tues and Thurs session this week or watching the recordings. Its the same every term, those that attend the session score the best marks. I say this because there is no way for me to convey in a discourse post all the important things to focus on. But I can do that in a 2 hour session. -------------------

I submitted the project
within the deadline
, and I ensured that
all requirements were fulfilled
, including correctly adding the MIT License file. The license file was named properly and contained the correct content. However, I received a message stating that the MIT License was not present, and that the prerequisites were not completed — resulting in a failed status. This is surprising and feels unfair, as I’ve double-checked my submission and confirmed that everything, including the license file, is in place and named correctly. Here is my GitHub repo for your reference:
GitHub - virajpitale/tds-project1
I kindly request a re-evaluation of my submission, as I believe I’ve met all the required criteria. I would really appreciate your time in looking into this matter again. Thank you for your understanding. @Jivraj

I completely appreciate that you feel these are minor issues. But the team has decided that we cannot allow students to make changes to their repos. Because someone else might have another minor issue they want to fix. We have to apply the rule uniformly. Unfortunately we cannot allow submissions that fail the prerequisites. Changing it now will not suddenly make it eligible. These things do matter when done at scale. Its an important lesson Anand wants students to understand. These “minor” things matter. Its a bit like assembling a rocket and forgetting the checklist for the pilot. Minor detail, costs Rs 2, but the rocket cannot leave without it. We had a significant discussion about it internally. For the sake of fairness to everyone who got it right, we cannot allow edits after the Project deadline. It makes the prerequisites meaningless, especially when it was clearly stressed upon in the sessions and the Project page. I know you will feel very disappointed but it is the decision the team has made and I have shared the reasons why. Kindest regards

Sir,
Thankyou for your prompt reply to my query. I wanted to let you know that i had made change of ‘LICENSE’ to ‘MIT LICENSE’ on the 16th of Feb itself as that was the day that i had received the mail and because I saw that the submission date had been extended by one day(i. e the 16th of Feb itself). I completely understand what you are trying to convey but that was the sole reason i made that change on the 16th. I completely respect your decision but if there is even a slight possibility that you consider it (only because I did it on the 16th) I would highly appreciate it. Thankyou!

Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent. Deadline:
Sunday, February 16, 2025 6:29 PM
Update on 27 Jan 2025
:
A
sample
evaluation script for Project 1 tasks A1-A10 is available at
tools-in-data-science-public/project-1 at tds-2025-01-project-1-wip · sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public · GitHub
You can use this to validate your code for Project 1. Please note:
This is a sample. It
WILL
change. Don’t rely on the dataset being the same. It
WILL
change. LLMs give different results each time they are called. Make sure:
Your code gives correct results
reliably
(i. e. try a few times)
Change the task in the evaluation script slightly to test variations
Your
AI Proxy usage
resets on 1 Feb. You have a limited budget. Utilize what you can this month. For those who
submit their code
by Friday 31 Jan, I will run a sample evaluation and share the results. -------------------

Hi Guddu ,
I didn’t make any changes to file and it worked for me. Can you mention what is need of making changes ?
command that I used :
uv run datagen. py 22f3002542@ds. study. iitm. ac. in --root. /data
here --root option defines the folder where you want to store generated data. by default it would try to create a folder in root directory of operating system. Kind regards

While implementing task A5, I am confused about what recent actually means in the phrase “recent log file”, mentioned under task A5, in the problem statement.

Please read the documentation carefully from top to bottom. So the main question is how do you test if the script will run according to the evaluation? The whole point is for it to run not just on your system. It should be deployable anywhere on any machine. Your solution should work anywhere we test it. Thats why you package it in a docker container. How you achieve that is up to you. But if we cannot run your docker container according to the specification we have provided then it has failed this crucial test. Kind regards

I submitted the form before the deadline with the API endpoint as /api, but I later realized the correct format was /api/ (with a trailing slash). To fix this, I edited the Google Form today.

It is not like that, it can be any endpoint, but whatever you submit should work. Like many frameworks treat /api/ and /api differently. The project 2 docs assumes that the endpoint is /api/ and provides the code accordingly. -------------------

Sir, I want to clarify something about the peer grading process. Some of the files of the student assigned to me are not accessble and others are missing. How am I to grade each thing? From what I understand analysis must be graded based on the shared files but if im not able to access them what should I do? I think requesting view access might violate the spirit of the grading exercise. Please help me out on what to do. Thanks. image

Upon checking further, in the assignment we were asked only to share access with se2002@study. iitm. ac. in. So I think all of us might have this issue. what do we do?

Hello everyone,
I have completed a working project of P2, but I want to test it out with actual questions from the GA’s. Is there anyone that can provide with sample question structure, or 1 or 2 questions as a form of ‘test cases’ so that we can try and fix our project?
Thank you very much in advance

I am really facing difficulty completing Project 2 on time as we had our OPPE exam yesterday, and the past week was dedicated to preparing for it. Additionally, due to an unforeseen emergency, I was unable to write the ROE exam, which resulted in lost marks. This makes it even more crucial for me to perform well in this project to make up for it. I sincerely request if it would be possible to extend the deadline by 2 days. This would allow me to put in my best effort and submit quality work. I truly value this opportunity and would be extremely grateful for your consideration.

Dear TDS Team,
I hope you are doing well. I am writing to highlight several issues and doubts related to different aspects of the course that require clarification and resolution. 1. Graded Assignments (GA)
GA6 Doubts Unresolved:
While doubts related to Q1 and Q2 have been addressed, other queries remain unresolved despite being posted in the GA6 thread. The deadline has passed, but no solutions have been provided. (Thread link)
GA Platform Changes:
Initially, we were solving questions on
exam. sanand. workers. dev. However, in GA6, we moved to
Seek
and in GA7, to
Google Forms. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments. 2. Project Updates
Project 1:
The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful. Project 2:
There are multiple doubts posted in the
Project 2
discussion thread, but they have not been addressed yet. Without these clarifications, it is difficult to proceed with the project. Could you please provide an expected timeline for when these queries will be resolved?
(thread link)
3. ROE Score Update
While ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected. I appreciate your time and assistance in addressing these concerns. Looking forward to your response. Best regards,
Lakshay

Seek
and in GA7, to
Google Forms. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments. The course is in transition. Initially all of it used to be on seek portal. But there were limitations of seek portal that we were not able to work around to deliver the kind of interactive, reactive and rapid corrections/iterations that are now possible because we moved the evaluations from the seek portal to the TDS server. Since the move to the new TDS server on the back end, we are able to also directly see students actual parameterised questions whenever doubts are raised. This is NOT possible on seek portal for us. The results are immediate to see. You got timely rapid feedback for GA 1 to GA 5 from the TAs. The TAs were also able to iterate quickly in discussion with the instructors and the professor as well as operations.",https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/concerns-regarding-various-issues-graded-assignments-project-doubts-and-roe-score-updates/170147,forum/content/1,93

And since the questions were parameterised, for technical reasons it was extremely cumbersome/risky/impossible to make changes without it being VERY disruptive to all students. These were some of the reasons we are transitioning. We have seen this problem term after term in prior terms with regards to the seek portal. This is a technological limitation of the current seek portal that directly impacts our ability to react to a dynamic course like TDS. GA 7 was decided to submit via forms again for the reasons listed above. GA6 was straightforward because it was a traditional evaluation. Whereas GA7 is once again very unique and does not handle well in being configured in Seek Portal. Since it was not possible in such a short time to transition GA7 to our preferred hosting server and student favourite, we opted for the least disruptive solution that we are able to action very quickly upon. lakshaygarg654:
Project 1:
The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful. Project 1 evaluations is VERY computationally intensive for us to evaluate. Each project although dockerised, with an average submission weighing at 2GB, we have to provision space of 1 TB along with the cloud computer resources for all of that (RAM and vCPUs) and if you thought creating project 1 was tough, you can imagine the technical challenge involved in evaluating the 600+ submissions with all the errors and issues we have to fix. In truth its all hands on deck for us here on the back end because it has been deemed critical. So while we are moving the course along, we are also aware that evaluations are at serious risk of missing crucial deadlines. We are taking the matter with utmost seriousness. Its just that we cant always keep you up to date on every set back we are facing. Each and everyone of us are concerned about Project 1 and are working on it. Anand, JK, Prasanna, myself, Jivraj and Saransh. We all have been given access to the eval server which we only managed to provision a few days ago and we are all trying to get the most ambitious TDS project evaluation out the dry dock and into the water and hoping it floats gracefully rather than sink in the estuary. Meanwhile we are busy patching the pipes in the belly of the ship while its rolling down the slipway. lakshaygarg654:

Thank you for your response
@carlton
and for addressing our concerns. We appreciate the efforts of the entire team in ensuring a smooth transition and improving the course experience. The reason for raising this separate post is that multiple doubts related to the course have been left unanswered over the past few days. Even if the course team provides a response without an immediate resolution, it would help us understand the ongoing process and what to expect next. We will wait for the resolution of GA6 issues and the release of Project 1 results. Regarding ROE, we initially assumed that marks would be awarded in the same manner as GA4 (110/100); however, now that you have clarified the maximum marks is 100. Meanwhile, we would like to know if a session can be arranged to discuss the solution for Project 1. This would be beneficial for us in working on Project 2. Additionally, any updates regarding the pending queries for Project 2 would be greatly appreciated. Looking forward to your response. Regards,

Now, my assignment score for all assignments (2,3,4,5) shows 0
I am attaching SS of my assignment-5 page to show there was no submit button available there
I had raised this as a ticket in the Support desk(21/Feb) in the past as discourse was not available to me at that time, but this didn’t get resolved. I saw a similar older thread where it was mentioned that this is not something to worry about but now it is showing in the portal that I am not allowed to take the End Term Exam. What can be done for this?

Hi Carlton,
I am writing to confirm the basic requirements for successfully completing the course. As I understand, the criteria for passing are:
Achieving a score greater than 40 marks in the graded assignments. Securing more than 40 marks in the end-term examination. Could you kindly confirm if this understanding is accurate? Additionally, please let me know if there are any other prerequisites to be met. -------------------

I would like to bring this to your attention that even though I submitted the ROE multiple times, the dashboard is showing absent. I hope the issue will be resolved at earliest as I am not the only one facing this issue

Hi
@carlton
@Jivraj
sir,
I wanted to bring to your attention that, although as you are already aware that I was present for the ROE and successfully submitted my exam, my dashboard currently reflects my status as “Absent. ”
I have attached a screenshot for your reference. I assume this might be a backend issue or that the scores are still being updated. Could you kindly look into this and confirm?
Thank you

After the session at 9pm there will be a session where we will show you the solutions step by step (not like the previous session which was a demo of ROE). To check your answers you will need to run the following script in the console. inputs = document. querySelectorAll('input')
textboxes = document. querySelectorAll(""textarea"")
buttons = document. querySelectorAll(""button"")
inputs. forEach(input => input. removeAttribute('disabled'));
buttons. forEach(input => input. removeAttribute('disabled'));

We will have it uploaded sometime this morning. It has two parts to it. The first part is the TAs solving the Mock in real time (however this is not a solutions session). The purpose of it is to get you to realise some key things:
The chaos of ROE. The adrenaline, speed of thought, the need to be very familiar with your tools. The limited time you have to use GPT effectively. It will help you with minor work flows, but not with complex tasks. (watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this). The value of efficient and effective collaboration. A hodgepodge of many people will not make an effective solutions team.",https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/mock-roe-1-2-3-4-tds-jan-2025/168449,forum/content/2,121
166048b5-9548-4ab6-901d-31a7c602bed4,6a55d7bb-0f12-4137-ad19-93b56e4ca344,content,"The ABSOLUTE importance of creating your own cheat sheet with code snippets that will help you solve ROE quickly
Workflow of ROE: Data Extraction → Data Cleaning → Data Transformation → Data Analyisis → Information to answer questions
The pitfalls of getting fixated on a question (a very common mistake and you can see it happen in the real time solving session as well). How limited the time is. The second part of the session was a debrief for the sheer shock that students felt. The goal of the mock was to acclimatise you to the shock of ROE. Past terms never had this benefit. We thought to take the shock factor out so that you can be better prepared than any term before. Emotions were raw. But this is normal. What is unusual is to have a preview of it before ROE. So the discussions were very intense even for us. Today’s Mock ROE will be more like a traditional solving session and deal with new aspects. It has the added bonus of being hosted on an exam server (without a time limit). I would still STRONGLY advise setting a horrible sounding alarm to acclimatise to the pressure cooker of ROE. You will make stupid mistakes under pressure. The TAs did yesterday as well. So best to reduce this factor by getting used to the clock. Kind regards

Hello
@carlton
sir , for me given constituency was
""SRI GOBINDPUR""
and in the dataset there are multiple names for this constituency i think over the period names were changed of this constituency
i have filtered constituencies from punjab using below code in colab
df_gobindpur = df[df[""AC""]. str. contains(""SRI GOBINDPUR|SRIHARGOBINDPUR|SRI HARGOBINDPUR"", case=False, na=False)]
is this correct approach or i have to consider only SRI GOBINDPUR name only? but then this constituency is not availble after 1957
using above filtering i got below data for SRI GOBINDPUR
drive. google. com
df_gobindpur. csv
Google Drive file. then i used margin formula as
margin_percentage = ((winner_votes - runner_up_votes) / total_votes) * 100
using this i got answer for 1st question as
YEAR                              1992
AC                   4 SRIHARGOBINDPUR
WINNER                  1 GURNAM SINGH
WINNER_PARTY                       CPI
WINNER_VOTES                    5000. 0
RUNNER_UP               2 MUSTAK MASIH
RUNNER_UP_PARTY                    INC
RUNNER_UP_VOTES                 1115. 0
MARGIN_PERCENTAGE            50. 599114
which is 50. 60 , but answer is 62. 64
pls guide where i might be wrong, thanks

@Jivraj
I wanted to let you know that I was unable to attend the ROE session today. I’ve been running a high fever since yesterday, and while I managed to complete my JAVA OPPE this morning, I started feeling much worse afterward. I felt it was necessary to get checked out by a doctor and unfortunately had to miss ROE as a result. I was wondering if there might be any possibility of taking the ROE at a later time? Please let me know if there’s anything I can do or if any arrangements can be made. -------------------

Q 7 LLM Embeddings (1 mark)
SecurePay
, a leading fintech startup, has implemented an innovative feature to detect and prevent fraudulent activities in real time. As part of its security suite, the system analyzes personalized transaction messages by converting them into embeddings. These embeddings are compared against known patterns of legitimate and fraudulent messages to flag unusual activity. Imagine you are working on the SecurePay team as a junior developer tasked with integrating the text embeddings feature into the fraud detection module. When a user initiates a transaction, the system sends a personalized v…

Dear
@jkmadathil
@Anand
@Bharathi
First and foremost, we sincerely appreciate the efforts of the
TDS team
in supporting us throughout this course. The
live sessions and guidance
have been helpful, and we recognize the intent to make this a valuable learning experience. However, despite these efforts, many of us have faced significant challenges in keeping up with the course expectations. Key Challenges Faced
Lack of Prerequisites
This course did not list any
prerequisites
, leading many students—including those from
non-technical backgrounds
—to enroll with the expectation that they could keep up. However, the reality is that the
course content, assignments, and projects
have been far more complex than anticipated, making it difficult to manage. Project Complexity & Deadline Pressure
The
difficulty of the projects
has been overwhelming, requiring most of us to
rely heavily on peer support
just to meet the deadlines. Despite putting in our best efforts, many of us struggled to complete them successfully. Course Structure Changes & Misleading Past Feedback
Many students joined
TDS
based on past
Discourse posts and feedback
, which suggested a different course structure. With the recent changes, it has been a tough transition—especially for
working professionals
and students without prior experience. Remote Open Exam (RoE) & Graded Assignments (GAs)
While we have put in significant effort—spending
2-3 days on Graded Assignments (GAs)
to secure good scores—we still find ourselves
struggling to meet expectations
for the
projects and RoE
, which are significantly harder than anticipated. We completely understand the need to maintain academic standards, but we also hope fairness is considered. Since many of us are putting in our best efforts but still finding it hard to meet the course demands, we kindly request a revision of the grading pattern. Increasing the weightage of Graded Assignments (GAs) would help ensure that the dedication and hard work of students are fairly reflected in their grades. This would allow students to pass with a reasonable grade while still maintaining the integrity of the course. We truly respect the effort that has gone into designing this course, and we are all here because we genuinely want to learn and grow. We only ask that the grading structure consider the diverse backgrounds of students so that everyone has a fair chance to succeed. Thank you for your time and understanding. We appreciate your consideration and hope to find a way forward that benefits both students and the course objectives. -------------------

I put 3 to 4 days on a GA. I still am not able to fully grasp the concept. I tried to attempt today’s mock roe, it was a disaster. I hope I can do better on next mock. I completed my project but due to some issue I failed to submit it. That’s was my mistake, and I highly regret it. I lost 20 marks because of it despite working so hard. -------------------

Hi
@s. anand
@jkmadathil
@Bharathi
@carlton
@Jivraj
@Saransh_Saini
Could you please look into the above issue?
Additionally, I’d like to highlight a concern regarding the current grading pattern ( JAN 2025 Term ) and overall course structuring:
Grading Concerns
Final Course Score:
T = 0. 15GAA + 0. 2 ROE1 + 0. 2 P1 + 0. 2 P2 + 0. 25 F
(The weightage of Projects + ROE accounts for 60% of the total score. )
From the following Discourse post, it appears that the ROE exam is extremely difficult to the point of being considered “impossible” by students:
What’s the actual purpose of impossible ROE exam?. Given this, many students may directly lose 20 marks due to ROE, significantly impacting their overall scores. Furthermore, for Project 1 (
deadline: 16th Feb 2025
), guidance was provided only in the week of the deadline. This was highly inconvenient, as the live session did not effectively address all student concerns. As a result, many students are at risk of losing a valuable 20 marks for Project 1. Course Structuring & Scheduling Issues
Many students pursuing this course are
dual-degree students or working professionals
, making it challenging to keep up with live sessions and deadlines. The
last-minute guidance
for projects adds unnecessary pressure, especially for those juggling work or other academic commitments. The
structuring and scheduling of sessions
feel inappropriate, with crucial guidance sessions being held too late, making it difficult to implement feedback or clarify doubts in time. Request for Improvement
To ensure a smoother learning experience, I request:
Early guidance and detailed instructions for Project 2
, well in advance of the deadline. More structured and accessible support
, considering the diverse student base, including working professionals. Better management of exam difficulty levels
, ensuring that assessments are fair and reflect actual learning rather than being unnecessarily tough. I hope these concerns can be taken into account, and necessary improvements can be made. Looking forward to your response. -------------------

Thank you
@A_LAKSHMI
for the detailed post. This is much appreciated. Thought of quickly stepping in before Anand or other members from the course team gives a more detailed response. Let me be Open and Blunt to all in saying that the
grading pattern will not be changed.",https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/concerns-regarding-tds-course-difficulty-and-grading-fairness/168476,forum/content/2,138

TDS team have been tinkering with the course structure for the past 3 terms. You can check this
Discourse thread
where students have unanimously said that this is not an easy subject. In fact the
first page of the TDS course
GA1 itself should have given everyone an indication of what lies ahead. Anand has explicitly written down the below words:
This course is quite hard
Here’s students’ feedback:
It
used
to be an easy course until 2024. #
#
#
Now it’s hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible. #
#
#
Plan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses. #
#
#
LLMs grade you – unpredictably. #
#
The ROE is hard. #
Take Graded assignment 1
to check if you’re ready for this course. Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It’ll be too tough for you now. TDS (or for that matter any course in this Degree program) is not supposed to be a single person effort. You should be realizing this even in your real life. A significant part of our learning process is social by nature. The only difference in this course is that we we explicitly encourage you to collaborate. If there is one main life lesson that we want you to learn out of this course then it is just this -
Surviving tough situations require support all around us, and there is no shame in asking for help
Again to quote Anand:
We encourage learning by sharing
You
CAN
copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam). Why should you copy?
Because in real life, there’s no time to re-invent the wheel. You’ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It’s important to learn how to do that well. To learn well, understand
what you’re copying. If you’re short of time, prioritize. To learn better, teach
what you’ve learnt. Now will be a good point to reflect on the optimization problem of Grades versus Learning. The larger question for each of you is to consider the short-term advantage of better grades versus the long term advantage of improving the fundamentals related to tools usage (not just for Data Science, but in every day life itself). Once again Anand has a
nice blog
where [I think] he is trying to explain that neither do we know nor do students realize what is going to ultimately benefit us. This is a journey that all of us are taking together, and we hope such open interactions along with the course will make the learning (or teaching) experience enjoyable  and internally make us more humble. Whether you like it or not, life is becoming more complex day by day.",https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/concerns-regarding-tds-course-difficulty-and-grading-fairness/168476,forum/content/3,139

And this is true even for the TDS course team members. Each of us are also juggling multiple responsibilities (some even doing 4 projects in this term) while ensuring that needed support can be provided to the learners. This is not lighten the issues that any of you have highlighted here, but just to point out that there is no flowery path for anyone here. Then the major question will be, why are all of doing this crazy business of learning tools in this way. The simplest answer is -
Tools are evolving day by day, and unless we realize that they are just “tools”, it is going to consume us an eternity to master them
The point of all the exercises and assessments, is for you to understand the fundamental aspects related to a tool and figure out your own strategies for getting a grip on them. @22f2001640
Management of time and difficulty levels are a shared responsibility. All of you have been sufficiently warned that the learning process wont be easy. In fact we have released all major content well in advance, so that learners can benefit from early access. And from our side, we also have realized the supporting learners wouldn’t be easy. But I see that the TDS course team members have been putting their heart and soul in this course (and support), and even in this week they have prepared 3 sets of ROEs in order to ensure that all of you get enough practice opportunity. -------------------

Regarding your point of the short term benefits of grades vs the long term benefits of learning, I think I’m speaking for a lot of my peers that we’re not concerned about grades at this point, we just at least want to pass this course. I’m a standalone degree potential student and while I have learned a lot from the modules and do not condone dumbing it down, but at least after all this hard work I should be able to pass the course. While grades don’t matter in front of learning things but when passing the course itself is on the line then the learnings are overshadowed by the lack of marks. I want to invest myself in the ROE and the remaining project, but at this point I’m so frustrated about getting at least 40 that rather than a valuable learning experience, this course seems like a burden to me. I understand that the grading can’t be changed. All I hope and request that project 2 and end term turn out to be more approachable than project 1 and ROE so that after all this hard work, students like me at least get the privilege to pass. -------------------

Whoever wants can participate and then we go into breakout rooms and each group solves a particular question and then we all share the code so we can complete the ROE faster and more effienctly?

Only for today’s ROE(mock 2) we can split  the tasks efficiently and get it done. Thoughts?

What's the actual purpose of impossible ROE exam?
Tools in Data Science
@ankit. jain
– I’m the culprit behind this RoE structure. Thanks for the opportunity to share my thought process. What does this RoE evaluate? Implicit learning. Implicit learning is “How much can they answer if woken up from sleep?”
Explicit learning is “How much can they answer given time and Internet?”

Some may know 10% implicitly. Some know 50%. They’ll answer those in a few seconds. Some, they can FIND out. with Google, StackOverflow, ChatGPT. That’s explicit learning. But it takes time…

Hello Sir,
I understand from the email we received that there are three mock ROEs scheduled. I wanted to check if it is mandatory to attempt the mock at 7 PM or if there is flexibility in the timing. As a working professional, I may not be able to attempt the mock at 7 PM. Could you please confirm if there is any flexibility in the timings? Additionally, I would appreciate it if you could provide details on when and how the mock links will be shared. Thanks and Regards
Shalini

It is not mandatory to attempt mocks at 7pm. But we will solve it in real time during the session. Thats why we are releasing it 1 hour before. We will freeze the form submissions during the solving session and then reopen it later. ROE is not like other exams you have done so far in this entire diploma. Solving it leisurely will give you a false sense of your capabilities. The truth is everyone can get full marks for ROE given enough time. The problem is the lack of time. So if you want to really check ROE readiness, fix the timer alarm for 45 mins and attempt it genuinely within the 45 mins. Only then will you know where you stand. Additionally, each ROE is completely different from the next. If you manage to do good in one is ZERO guarantee that you will do good in the next. Thats why do all 4 mock ROEs. ROE is not like any other exam. Other exams have the same types of questions. Not with ROE. The real ROE will be also something that no one has seen before. But we will help you be as ready as possible for it. Kind regards

You will get an email at 7pm with the ROE dataset and the question form. I will also add the same in the student seek portal. Mock ROEs are not proctored (its a mock!) and the actual ROE is not proctored either!
The gmeet is after the mock ROE where it will be solved live by the TDS team. Kind regards

    method, url, status = parts[5][1:], parts[6], int(parts[8])
    return log_time, method, url, status

with gzip. open(log_path, 'rt') as file:
    for entry in file:
        log_time, method, url, status = parse_log(entry)
        if method == 'GET' and url. startswith('/blog/') and 200 <= status < 300:
            if log_time. weekday() == 0 and start_time <= log_time. time() < end_time:

Dear team,
Greetings of the day
I am writing this to request for a functionality
Practice the GAs again after their deadline has passed
Either the answers can be posted or the same question answering and simultaneous evaluation interface can work just like it does before the deadline. How this is beneficial?
As the GATE exam has now been completed,  we can now practice the questions we either left or could not do at that time
Revision will help us ace the ROE, project and end term
Overall this will increase the value of the already most practical and rewarding course of IIT BS i. e TDS. Looking forward to your guidance and kind consideration
Regards
Aryan

Release of Project 2 has been delayed by 3 days, and release of Assignment 6 has been delayed by 10 days. Could you please clarify if the submission dates will be changed accordingly? I am assuming it will have to be changed for Assignment 7 as well. Please let me know rough submission dates if possible so that I can plan accordingly (my schedule in the upcoming days is very hectic). -------------------

Content:
Project 1 was based on Module 1 through 3. Project 2 will encompass Module 4 through 6 (and possibly 7) but not to the exclusion of the prior modules. These are not set in stone and still is in the design/validation phase. We generally avoid calling it week 3 content etc. because all the content was released as modules at the beginning well before the term was started. The GAs are released as we complete validations on them. Each term the course assignments are updated to stay current with industry expectations. So they are not recycled like subjects that are static like maths, statistics and programming which have syllabi that have not changed in 10 years or more. We try to release GAs so that they match the cadence of the other subjects for the convenience of students wherever possible. But rarely do other subjects require constant revalidation for their GAs. Hence we have situations, even in past terms, where GAs and Projects get moved to allow for robust validations of the answers. In spite of this some errors do slip through due to the aggressive time schedule in a trimester system as opposed to a semester system. Hope that give you some insight into how TDS works. Thanks for bearing with us. TDS is perpetually a WIP. Kind regards

Hi TDS team, with ROE being ahead, i assume an official thread will be created soon. Here are few doubts from my side. I request the official post to cover these. Syllabus
kindly hint us on the type of questions, kind of tools to practice
I did my ROE the last term, the time was not enough for me. I would like to know if it is actually possible to solve all the questions within the time
Any mock or resource to practice from?
additional tips, if any

Questions will be similar to GAs and the content in the modules. ROE is quite hard. Only a small number will be able to do it in the given time frame. We will have some past ROEs as practise
… watch sessions

@carlton
Is it safe to assume that ROE is nothing but a “GA with extremely short deadline” since we don’t have proctors ? Or is the ROE more complex structured ?
P. S. I am not saying the questions will be hard or easy, just asking about structure. -------------------

ROEs are always unique. They can be of any kind. We do not fix one method. Therefore its not possible to say what kind of questions will be there whether MCQ, MSQ or numerical or text etc. Kind regards

Content:
The ROEs are not GAs with short deadlines. A GA question usually tests one concept in isolation. ROEs typically require you to combine multiple concepts and use multiple tools in order to answer the question. (in a very short time). If your goal is totally rely on the LLM to solve it for you… past experience shows us that ROEs complexity is usually difficult for an LLM to overcome without significant assistance from the “hooomann”
So practise with the concepts are going to be key without having to look up everything because looking up everything takes too much time. Collaboration with others is going be helpful. ROE is not proctored and is open internet. There is a reason for that. Its very hard. There will be a dataset or multiple datasets. Sometimes you may have to combine datasets to answer questions. You will have to extract data from the dataset. You will have to transform/clean the data and you will have to gain some information from the data, is what typical ROEs test. Kind regards

– please try again after reloading the page. The new error message will be clearer, like this:
Error: At [0]. rating: Values don't match. Expected: ""7. 4"". Actual: 7. 4
FYI, we expect all values as strings, not numbers. That’s because the year can sometimes be a range for a TV series (e. g. 2021 - 2024) and the rating can sometimes be missing. -------------------

In Question 2, it is specifically said to filter the movies however, the evaluator is expecting a TV show there. Should we also include TV shows now?
edit:  This is an everchanging dataset, so will our answers be saved, as, this json might not be in this order tomorrow?

Just a quick query on the Bonus mark. Would this be added to the final grade? Say for example, Someone get a full score in the first 4 assignments. So the total comes up to 39. 5/39. 5, and would be converted to 0. 15 or 15 marks. Would the bonus mark be additional to that 15 or would the score change to 40. 5/39. 5 and then get normalised to 15?

It will be added to the GA4 marks, not the final grade. So, it’s roughly worth 0. 15% on the total - not a full 1% on the total. -------------------.",https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga4-data-sourcing-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/165959,forum/content/2,169

QUESTION 9
I was supposed to transcribe the audio of the provided video for a certain time period. After several attempts my submission still generated differences from the supposed answers. I have tried all forms of re-punctuations but the error wont budge. I even compared the generated transcript with the actual audio several times. I BELIEVE MY ANSWER IS CORRECT. If not I wish to know what the correct answer is. Because compared to the video I have provided the exact and well punctuated transcription of the audio between 397. 2 and 505. 5 seconds. Here was my transcription - "" Determined to confront the mystery, Miranda followed the elusive figure. In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed. In a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure’s voice emerged from the gloom, “You are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again. ”
The mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal—a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice. Victor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind. From within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund’s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations. Miranda’s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor’s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor’s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation ""

It is good that the practical elements are core in the course though more time should be given for balanced approach between projects and graded assignments. There were some issues I faced. For example, the GitHub link of the datagen. py was incorrect and I was confused due to the code not generating the expected outcome. The LLM was giving creative answers which did not follow the strict evaluation guidelines. So, the case was not passed. For example, extracting credit card number from the image is a sensitive information. I am alright with it since the evaluation will be different. Now, I am really well versed with the tools taught in these weeks. Thanking the whole TDS Team for this project which was very well designed. -------------------

I got a mail saying my Dockerfile is missing. However I have a dockerfile already in my github repository. Is it an issue with the spelling of dockerfile since I have submitted it in all small case as ‘dockerfile’. It was showing the score when I checked with the evaluate. py that was provided by iitm. Shall I just change the name of the file from ‘dockerfile’ to ‘Dockerfile’ in github repository of mine or is there anything else that is needed to detect the Dockerfile?

The name of the Dockerfile should be “Dockerfile” indeed, more over check other sections of your submission like
Is the GitHub repo public?
Does it have an MIT license?
Does it have a DockerFile?
Is the Docker image accessible?

The name of the file on remote repository did not change even after commit it through my local repo, once I read the mail in morning it was only then I realised it wasn’t changed on GitHub repo. Sir I understand the deadline has passed and I am not asking for a resubmission, I am just asking to consider the already submitted work, just that. It would be really helpful.

So the reason for the failure is:
You had initially put your Dockerfile inside a directory called TDSP-1-main instead of being directly in your repo. (On 15th Feb 1:26AM)
Then when our automated script checked if students repos met the requirements and yours did not we immediately sent out a warning email as a opportunity for students to make the necessary corrections. Then once you realised your mistake, on
Feb 17th at 9:11 pm IST
i. e
yesteday
, you changed your repo to put the files in the correct locations. Then you finally posted here on Discourse with the image [quote=“21f3002647, post:1, topic:167471”]
image
250×534 3. 92 KB
[/quote]
showing that your files are in the correct place. We do not take into consideration modifications to your repo after the deadline because then we would have to extend that curtesy to all students. Kind regards

sir
Yes, I corrected my repo at 9:11 PM IST, but I had actually written and submitted my query much earlier at 4 PM. At that time, I wasn’t entirely sure if this was the actual issue, but it looks like it was. I understand that the deadline had already passed, and I only saw the email later. I had two GATE papers on the 15th and an interview on the 16th, so I was extremely busy and couldn’t check my emails sooner. However, I had raised my concern well before making the correction, so I’d really appreciate it if my submission could still be considered
Kind regards,

I have discussed this with the rest of the TDS team and with Operations on multiple occasions (including today. ) Here are the highlights of the discussion:
We have moved Graded Assignment 5 (GA5) deadline which was due on 16th Feb to 21st Feb next Friday. All the material to be able to do Project was available in Module 2 and Module 3, which was released on or before 10th of January (36 days ago)
Project 1 was released 19th of January (27 days ago)
We had over 9 hours of sessions exclusively covering Project 1 (of which at least 8 hours are available on YouTube. ) This excludes any week 2 and week 3 content which also would have given you the necessary skills to do Project 1. The sessions on YouTube give you a start to finish overview of how to approach it. All of your concerns were duly noted and mentioned. Considering all the above, including the concerns mentioned by students:
Project 1 deadline will NOT be changed. Please make sure to carefully read the Deliverables and the Evaluation section and do them carefully and watch the intro to Week 3 - Session 1 to get an overview of what is absolutely essential and required. Watch Week 5 both sessions to see how we construct these requirements. Kind regards
TDS Team

We truly appreciate the efforts being put by the TDS team, but not to be rude here -
Why is Project 1 deadline is on Saturday and not on Sunday, as many of us are doing the course
not as a full-time
student. (Some have Gate exam on Saturday also). So, extending the timeline to at least Sunday, 16th Feb would be truly appreciated. Week 3 release date timeline is 24 Jan, we need adequate time to go through the weekly materials.",https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/request-for-postponing-the-project-1-deadline-official-response-extended/166866,forum/content/2,196

Project help sessions came on 11th February(live) and 12th Feb on YouTube, just 4 days before the submission date, though I am not complaining about this and genuinely appreciating the team’s effort, but this does gives very less time for many of us here.

Hi Sakshi,
The error is quite clear, it cannot find the file /data/contacts. json

Sakshi as the error says it’s unable to find your file. Try adding a. (dot) before the location. -------------------

Author: Sakshi6479
Date: 2025-02-14T14:32:12. 846Z
Content:
sir i have used the dot(. ) while sending the request to postman in the query which i provided to the task. Is the dot(. ) should be added somewhere else?
-------------------

Author: Saransh_Saini
Date: 2025-02-14T15:07:26. 713Z
Content:
If you have added that dot as a prefix to your locations then, you would have to structure your query_gpt in such a way that it takes these dots into consideration. -------------------

Currently we do not have any explicit policy regarding requiring IITM email as the github profile name or the github repo owner. We DO however require you to use your IITM email when submitting the project submission form. We are clarifying with operations at the moment if this arrangement satisfies their requirements. If it changes we will make a general announcement via email, portal and discourse. (we do not expect the current requirements of github to change)

Hi Vikram,
This is because (if you watched the session, or examined the code, you would have realised that) datagen. py was designed to run inside your docker container. And datagen. py (or a similar named file which we will not tell you ahead of time and will be provided as the query parameter in task A1) will normally be called by evaluate. py
Inside the docker container, permission for the data folder is set by the Dockerfile
which then allows your application to access the root folder inside your docker image and create the /data folder. So the workflow is like this (for your internal testing only… please follow the Project page for deliverables and evaluation to submit project successfully):
You create your application server that serves 2 endpoints on localhost:8000
You create a docker image that runs this application server. You run the docker image using podman as described in the project page. For mimicking the testing conditions. You need two files:
evaluate. py and datagen. py to be in the same folder where you are running these two scripts. Run evalute. py using uv. If your docker image is correctly configured and your application is correctly configured, then all the tasks run by evaluate. py will correctly tell you if the application is producing the right result for each task. Hope that gives clarity. Kind regards

I realized there are still many topics to learn in order to complete the TDS Course ( With an A or S Grade) as I have missed some questions (Couldn’t do even after studying the videos ). Therefore wanted to learn and regardless of the scoring I still wish to complete GA1 but, I see that I can’t access the questions  anymore …
Is there any way to give the answers in the portal and check. I just want to learn and test my knowledge

The lectures primarily focus on surface-level explanations without ensuring a strong foundational understanding of the topics. Key concepts, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and related technologies, are not explained in a structured manner, making it difficult for students to follow. -------------------

Hi Hari,
The goal of the course was never to go deep into specific technologies, with perhaps the exception of LLMs as major tooling capability for data science. Due to the volume of the content in the first 3 weeks it was decided to at least get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded Assignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions were too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or not involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students. The quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and well attended. Have you watched this session in particular?
If thats insufficient for you last term we did a 2hr 48 min session on just introducing it
followed by another 2 hour detailed explanation of the more advanced use cases
But of course does everyone want to watch 5. 5 hours of sessions to understand it? That depends on the student. Ultimately the best you can get out of sessions is by actually attending them because only then can we address gaps in understanding. Kind regards

Is it considered best practice to create a virtual environment rather than installing packages globally, especially when working on projects that require multiple libraries? I understand that in a professional setting, we often work on multiple projects simultaneously, and developing the habit of using virtual environments now can help reinforce this practice for future projects. Additionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements. txt file? My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements. txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation. However, I have encountered instances where a specific version failed to install, requiring me to modify the requirements. txt file and remove the version constraint. In such cases, wouldn’t installing directly via pip be more practical?
That said, I also recognize that different projects may have unique dependency requirements. I’d appreciate your insights on best practices for managing dependencies efficiently. -------------------

Yes, using a virtual environment is definitely considered best practice when working on Python projects. This approach helps avoid dependency conflicts between projects and ensures a consistent development environment. The main reasons why you should use virtual environments:
Isolation
– Each project has its own set of dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects. Reproducibility
– A virtual environment ensures that all contributors work with the same dependencies. Portability
– You can share a project with others (or deploy it) without worrying about system-wide package versions interfering. Installing with pip individually (pip install package-name)
• Good for quick experimentation and testing. • Not ideal for long-term project management because dependencies might update and break compatibility over time. Using requirements. txt
• Best for
reproducibility
and
collaboration
since others can install the exact same dependencies using pip install -r requirements. txt. • Avoids issues where one developer uses an updated library that breaks compatibility with another developer’s setup. Specifying Versions in requirements. txt
• If you
don’t specify a version
, pip install -r requirements. txt will install the latest available versions, which might introduce unexpected breaking changes. • If you
do specify a version (package==1. 2. 3)
, you ensure consistency but may run into problems if that version becomes unavailable or has compatibility issues. Handling Version Conflicts
• If a package version fails to install, try removing the strict version constraint and reinstall. • Instead of completely omitting version numbers, consider:
• Using
greater than/less than constraints
: package>=1. 2,<2. 0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes). • Running pip freeze > requirements. txt after confirming a stable environment. Best Practices Summary
Always use a virtual environment (e. g. , venv or conda). Use a
requirements. txt
file for reproducibility. Pin versions cautiously—avoid unnecessary strict versioning unless needed. Periodically review and update dependencies to prevent using outdated or insecure packages. Kind regards

For some projects where there are many dependencies, like an ML project or flask app, it’s better you mantain a virtual environment since the dependencies are interconnected with their versions. Whereas for some simple projects, with less dependencies, global installation is fine. For project that is to be deployed, make sure you use the virtual environment, only then you can ensure what worked for you also works on the deployement
24f2006531:
Additionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements. txt file?
Coming to your second question,
The first time you install a fresh dependency, use direct and latest version. But if you are cloning or thinking of sharing the repo or using someone’s project it’s better to use requirements. txt. 24f2006531:
My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements. txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation
The creation of requirements. txt ensures that the current installation version is listed. Never try to list requirements. txt. There is a command to do that,
pip3 freeze > requirements. txt. This does the hard work of listing the dependencies for you

Thank you sir for clarifying. carlton:
• Using
greater than/less than constraints
: package>=1. 2,<2. 0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes). I wasn’t aware of greater than/less than constraint.

The knowledge required by students to do TDS has been revised during recent terms. ( Mentioned that as per industrial standards/ needs). Additional programming skills are required(in addition to Python) to follow the TDS Course. That means indirectly, one should complete many courses diploma in programming before doing TDS. In such a case, how to drop the course Tools In Data Science(already registered) and get it replaced with another course to save time and without incurring financial losses(as dropping a course refunds only a certain percentage of fees amount paid for the course), and do it again later in terms. It’s completely IIT Madras’s fault since it was mentioned in the academics site that no prerequisites were required for the course while the reality turned out to be far from promises. I want to either get the course structure for the TDS revised or get it replaced with some another course; incase of some course fee difference, I will pay the difference amount. -------------------

Hi Shalini,
We are aware of the issue and

is working on a solution. The temporary fix is to just reenter all the answers before hitting the Save button. Thanks for the reminder, please bear with the inconvenience while its being fixed. The last submission is always saved. So please make sure that your last submission contains all the answers for all the questions. Kind regards

Hello,
I am also facing the same issue. In my last submission the score was 7. 25. Right now it is showing 0. The problem is i had few questions remaining to solve and i dont know which ones now. All of them r showing empty in the solution box. Also i didnt write my answers someplace else, so i would have to solve all the questions again? And also if i just for example for testing submit solution of 1 question now then my score would get reduced from 7. 25 to the marks of that 1 question i submitted right?

I added a “Recent saves” feature. This will show the time and score for the last 3 times you saved. You can load from any of these. [image]

I feel that Week 1 is packed with tutorials from diverse areas. While I understand the necessity of these tutorials, they lack immediate exercises, which makes it difficult to retain the knowledge gained. Attempting to practice everything from these tutorials leaves insufficient time for other courses. Additionally, while solving GAs helps reinforce learning, they don’t seem to cover all the concepts from the tutorials. I would want to know whether the learning from GAs is sufficient or if there’s a better way to balance this. PS - To address this at a management level, my suggestion would be to introduce AQs  or  mini exercises after each module. Alternatively, we could increase questions in GAs to cover more concepts, though the first approach might be more effective. Another improvement could be to reduce the diversity of content in a single week to make it more manageable. -------------------.",https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/need-clarity/164205,forum/content/1,269

While I’m eager to take it on, I feel my current skill set might fall short of the project’s demands. I’m committed to pushing my boundaries and would greatly appreciate your guidance on topics or resources that could help me prepare more effectively during my free time. I want to ensure I can contribute something meaningful and engaging, even if the outcome isn’t perfect. If there are any recommended readings, practice problems, or areas of focus that you believe would provide a solid foundation for approaching this project, I would be very grateful for your suggestions. Thank you for considering my request. I’m genuinely excited by the challenge and hope to make the most of this opportunity to learn and grow under your guidance. @s. anand

In ROE , usually you have to find the answers of the questions by solving them using codes and tools explained in the course. For example you have a large pdf file of some patients and their disease and you are said to find number patients having some XYZ disease in that pdf. Now you can get this answer by using parsing tools and few lines of codes and after getting the results you can write that answer back in the portal.
