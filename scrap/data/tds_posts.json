We had all planned our submissions based on the clearly communicated “best 4 out of 7” policy. This unexpected shift has raised concerns about transparency and fairness principles that should be central to academic assessment. Fairness is not a privilege to be selectively granted; it is a fundamental right for every student. We respectfully urge the course coordinators to offer clarification and ensure that all students are evaluated on an equal footing. We hope the final grading reflects both justice and academic integrity.\n-------------------\n\nAuthor: Haricharan\nDate: 2025-04-09T14:28:31.250Z\nContent:\n@carlton\n@Jivraj\n@Saransh_Saini\n@s.anand\nYes Sir, I also completed 6 GAs even tho it was written only best 4 out of 7 GAs would be considered for final grade, but couldn’t complete GA 7 due to pressure of other subjects, if it was written in the grading document I would have done it, hoping you would understand Sir, Please do consider our request.\nThank you\n-------------------\n\nAuthor: Namannn28\nDate: 2025-04-09T14:40:38.325Z\nContent:\n@carlton\nsir in the grading document it was mentioned best 4 out of 7 assignments but I did 6 GAs but skipped GA7 due to other assignments and projects but now we got to know that 5 bonus marks are given in ga 7 which seems unfair to all of us as mostly people who did GA7 are the one who were not able to complete previous GAs so giving bonus for the last day give them a edge\nIf it was announced before deadline of GA 7 it was okay and good for us to improve our grade but now it seems quite unfair so, please come with the best possible solution for this\nThanking you\nwaiting for your answer\n-------------------"

Because someone else might have another minor issue they want to fix. We have to apply the rule uniformly.\nUnfortunately we cannot allow submissions that fail the prerequisites.\nChanging it now will not suddenly make it eligible.\nThese things do matter when done at scale.  Its an important lesson Anand wants students to understand. These “minor” things matter.\nIts a bit like assembling a rocket and forgetting the checklist for the pilot. Minor detail, costs Rs 2, but the rocket cannot leave without it.\nWe had a significant discussion about it internally. For the sake of fairness to everyone who got it right, we cannot allow edits after the Project deadline. It makes the prerequisites meaningless, especially when it was clearly stressed upon in the sessions and the Project page.\nI know you will feel very disappointed but it is the decision the team has made and I have shared the reasons why.\nKindest regards\n-------------------\n\nAuthor: 22f3000585\nDate: 2025-04-02T15:20:45.985Z\nContent:\nSir,\nThankyou for your prompt reply to my query.\nI wanted to let you know that i had made change of ‘LICENSE’ to ‘MIT LICENSE’ on the 16th of Feb itself as that was the day that i had received the mail and because I saw that the submission date had been extended by one day(i.e the 16th of Feb itself).\nI completely understand what you are trying to convey but that was the sole reason i made that change on the 16th.\nI completely respect your decision but if there is even a slight possibility that you consider it (only because I did it on the 16th) I would highly appreciate it.\nThankyou!\n-------------------\n\nAuthor: carlton\nDate: 2025-04-02T15:55:00.653Z\nContent:\nOne thing we are doing is looking at the latest commit before the 18th of Feb. So if it was correct before the 18th of Feb then we will consider it and evaluate it, but it has to be precisely what is expected. If so, then your submission will be evaluated by building the image from the docker manifest in the github present at the version before the 18th.\n-------------------\n\nAuthor: 22f3000585\nDate: 2025-04-02T16:02:57.956Z\nContent:\nWell noted sir.

I am writing to highlight several issues and doubts related to different aspects of the course that require clarification and resolution.\n1. Graded Assignments (GA)\nGA6 Doubts Unresolved:\nWhile doubts related to Q1 and Q2 have been addressed, other queries remain unresolved despite being posted in the GA6 thread . The deadline has passed, but no solutions have been provided.\n(Thread link)\nGA Platform Changes:\nInitially, we were solving questions on\nexam.sanand.workers.dev\n. However, in GA6, we moved to\nSeek\nand in GA7, to\nGoogle Forms\n. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments.\n2. Project Updates\nProject 1:\nThe result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful.\nProject 2:\nThere are multiple doubts posted in the\nProject 2\ndiscussion thread, but they have not been addressed yet. Without these clarifications, it is difficult to proceed with the project. Could you please provide an expected timeline for when these queries will be resolved?\n(thread link)\n3. ROE Score Update\nWhile ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected.\nI appreciate your time and assistance in addressing these concerns. Looking forward to your response.\nBest regards,\nLakshay\n-------------------\n\nAuthor: 23f2004912\nDate: 2025-03-17T05:51:22.965Z\nContent:\ntigertds\n212×148 6.99 KB\n@carlton\nIt’s been over a month, and now an extra day has been taken as well—when will TDS Project 1 finally be released? The delay is getting excessive; some clarity on the timeline would be appreciated.\n-------------------\n\nAuthor: carlton\nDate: 2025-03-17T08:10:53.775Z\nContent:\nlakshaygarg654:\nGA Platform Changes:\nInitially, we were solving questions on\nexam.sanand.workers.dev\n. However, in GA6, we moved to\nSeek\nand in GA7, to\nGoogle Forms\n. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments.\nThe course is in transition. Initially all of it used to be on seek portal. But there were limitations of seek portal that we were not able to work around to deliver the kind of interactive, reactive and rapid corrections/iterations that are now possible because we moved the evaluations from the seek portal to the TDS server. Since the move to the new TDS server on the back end, we are able to also directly see students actual parameterised questions whenever doubts are raised. This is NOT possible on seek portal for us. The results are immediate to see. You got timely rapid feedback for GA 1 to GA 5 from the TAs. The TAs were also able to iterate quickly in discussion with the instructors and the professor as well as operations.\nWith GA 6 our inability to actually see your individual question sets immediately (its possible, but it has to take a very circuitous route via 3 set of people) meant we were always on the back foot for both, checking the answers, as well as making any corrections. And since the questions were parameterised, for technical reasons it was extremely cumbersome/risky/impossible to make changes without it being VERY disruptive to all students. These were some of the reasons we are transitioning. We have seen this problem term after term in prior terms with regards to the seek portal. This is a technological limitation of the current seek portal that directly impacts our ability to react to a dynamic course like TDS.\nGA 7 was decided to submit via forms again for the reasons listed above. GA6 was straightforward because it was a traditional evaluation. Whereas GA7 is once again very unique and does not handle well in being configured in Seek Portal. Since it was not possible in such a short time to transition GA7 to our preferred hosting server and student favourite, we opted for the least disruptive solution that we are able to action very quickly upon.\nlakshaygarg654:\nProject 1:\nThe result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful.\nProject 1 evaluations is VERY computationally intensive for us to evaluate. Each project although dockerised, with an average submission weighing at 2GB, we have to provision space of 1 TB along with the cloud computer resources for all of that (RAM and vCPUs) and if you thought creating project 1 was tough, you can imagine the technical challenge involved in evaluating the 600+ submissions with all the errors and issues we have to fix. In truth its all hands on deck for us here on the back end because it has been deemed critical. So while we are moving the course along, we are also aware that evaluations are at serious risk of missing crucial deadlines. We are taking the matter with utmost seriousness. Its just that we cant always keep you up to date on every set back we are facing.\nEach and everyone of us are concerned about Project 1 and are working on it. Anand, JK, Prasanna, myself, Jivraj and Saransh. We all have been given access to the eval server which we only managed to provision a few days ago and we are all trying to get the most ambitious TDS project evaluation out the dry dock and into the water and hoping it floats gracefully rather than sink in the estuary. Meanwhile we are busy patching the pipes in the belly of the ship while its rolling down the slipway.\nlakshaygarg654:\n3. ROE Score Update\nWhile ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected.\nYou got the maximum possible mark in ROE. Does it not show you got 100 in ROE in the dashboard? I have been told by operations that it has been pushed.\nKind regards\n-------------------\n\nAuthor: carlton\nDate: 2025-03-17T08:16:00.295Z\nContent:\nWe do not know yet. Please read reply to the original poster.\nThanks,\nKind regards\n-------------------\n\nAuthor: lakshaygarg654\nDate: 2025-03-17T12:43:30.265Z\nContent:\nThank you for your response\n@carlton\nand for addressing our concerns. We appreciate the efforts of the entire team in ensuring a smooth transition and improving the course experience.\nThe reason for raising this separate post is that multiple doubts related to the course have been left unanswered over the past few days. Even if the course team provides a response without an immediate resolution, it would help us understand the ongoing process and what to expect next.\nWe will wait for the resolution of GA6 issues and the release of Project 1 results. Regarding ROE, we initially assumed that marks would be awarded in the same manner as GA4 (110/100); however, now that you have clarified the maximum marks is 100.\nMeanwhile, we would like to know if a session can be arranged to discuss the solution for Project 1. This would be beneficial for us in working on Project 2. Additionally, any updates regarding the pending queries for Project 2 would be greatly appreciated.\nLooking forward to your response.\nRegards,\nLakshay\n-------------------"

The first part is the TAs solving the Mock in real time (however this is not a solutions session). The purpose of it is to get you to realise some key things:\nThe chaos of ROE.\nThe adrenaline, speed of thought, the need to be very familiar with your tools.\nThe limited time you have to use GPT effectively. It will help you with minor work flows, but not with complex tasks. (watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this).\nThe value of efficient and effective collaboration. A hodgepodge of many people will not make an effective solutions team.\nThe ABSOLUTE importance of creating your own cheat sheet with code snippets that will help you solve ROE quickly\nWorkflow of ROE: Data Extraction → Data Cleaning → Data Transformation → Data Analyisis → Information to answer questions\nThe pitfalls of getting fixated on a question (a very common mistake and you can see it happen in the real time solving session as well).\nHow limited the time is.\nThe second part of the session was a debrief for the sheer shock that students felt. The goal of the mock was to acclimatise you to the shock of ROE.\nPast terms never had this benefit. We thought to take the shock factor out so that you can be better prepared than any term before. Emotions were raw. But this is normal. What is unusual is to have a preview of it before ROE. So the discussions were very intense even for us.\nToday’s Mock ROE will be more like a traditional solving session and deal with new aspects. It has the added bonus of being hosted on an exam server (without a time limit).\nI would still STRONGLY advise setting a horrible sounding alarm to acclimatise to the pressure cooker of ROE. You will make stupid mistakes under pressure. The TAs did yesterday as well. So best to reduce this factor by getting used to the clock.\nKind regards\n-------------------\n\nAuthor: carlton\nDate: 2025-02-26T03:58:46.473Z\nContent:\n\n-------------------\n\nAuthor: 23f2003413\nDate: 2025-02-26T04:02:53.908Z\nContent:\nThank you! will check out the session today\n-------------------\n\nAuthor: shubhamatkal\nDate: 2025-02-26T09:16:29.955Z\nContent:\nHello\n@carlton\nsir , for me given constituency was\n\"SRI GOBINDPUR\"\nand in the dataset there are multiple names for this constituency i think over the period names were changed of this constituency\ni have filtered constituencies from punjab using below code in colab\ndf_gobindpur = df[df[\"AC\"].str.contains(\"SRI GOBINDPUR|SRIHARGOBINDPUR|SRI HARGOBINDPUR\", case=False, na=False)]\nis this correct approach or i have to consider only SRI GOBINDPUR name only? but then this constituency is not availble after 1957\nusing above filtering i got below data for SRI GOBINDPUR\ndrive.google.com\ndf_gobindpur.csv\nGoogle Drive file.\nthen i used margin formula as\nmargin_percentage = ((winner_votes - runner_up_votes) / total_votes) * 100\nusing this i got answer for 1st question as\nYEAR                              1992\nAC                   4 SRIHARGOBINDPUR\nWINNER                  1 GURNAM SINGH\nWINNER_PARTY                       CPI\nWINNER_VOTES                    5000.0\nRUNNER_UP               2 MUSTAK MASIH\nRUNNER_UP_PARTY                    INC\nRUNNER_UP_VOTES                 1115.0\nMARGIN_PERCENTAGE            50.599114\nwhich is 50.60 , but answer is 62.64\npls guide where i might be wrong, thanks\n-------------------\n\nAuthor: Jivraj\nDate: 2025-02-26T11:23:42.616Z\nContent:\nshubhamatkal:\ndf_gobindpur = df[df[\"AC\"].str.contains(\"SRI GOBINDPUR|SRIHARGOBINDPUR|SRI HARGOBINDPUR\", case=False, na=False)]\nFor this kind of name difference you can use Openrefine software\nshubhamatkal:\nwhich is 50.60 , but answer is 62.64\nThat answer is wrong, we will be releasing a script with correct python snippets.\nKind regards.\n-------------------\n\nAuthor: 23f2005138\nDate: 2025-02-26T12:47:56.303Z\nContent:\n@Jivraj\n@carlton\n“SATHUPALLE” and “NILANGA” were two of the four constituencies which were assigned to me.

The\nlive sessions and guidance\nhave been helpful, and we recognize the intent to make this a valuable learning experience.\nHowever, despite these efforts, many of us have faced significant challenges in keeping up with the course expectations.\nKey Challenges Faced\nLack of Prerequisites\nThis course did not list any\nprerequisites\n, leading many students—including those from\nnon-technical backgrounds\n—to enroll with the expectation that they could keep up. However, the reality is that the\ncourse content, assignments, and projects\nhave been far more complex than anticipated, making it difficult to manage.\nProject Complexity & Deadline Pressure\nThe\ndifficulty of the projects\nhas been overwhelming, requiring most of us to\nrely heavily on peer support\njust to meet the deadlines. Despite putting in our best efforts, many of us struggled to complete them successfully.\nCourse Structure Changes & Misleading Past Feedback\nMany students joined\nTDS\nbased on past\nDiscourse posts and feedback\n, which suggested a different course structure. With the recent changes, it has been a tough transition—especially for\nworking professionals\nand students without prior experience.\nRemote Open Exam (RoE) & Graded Assignments (GAs)\nWhile we have put in significant effort—spending\n2-3 days on Graded Assignments (GAs)\nto secure good scores—we still find ourselves\nstruggling to meet expectations\nfor the\nprojects and RoE\n, which are significantly harder than anticipated.\nWe completely understand the need to maintain academic standards, but we also hope fairness is considered. Since many of us are putting in our best efforts but still finding it hard to meet the course demands, we kindly request a revision of the grading pattern. Increasing the weightage of Graded Assignments (GAs) would help ensure that the dedication and hard work of students are fairly reflected in their grades. This would allow students to pass with a reasonable grade while still maintaining the integrity of the course.\nWe truly respect the effort that has gone into designing this course, and we are all here because we genuinely want to learn and grow. We only ask that the grading structure consider the diverse backgrounds of students so that everyone has a fair chance to succeed.\nThank you for your time and understanding. We appreciate your consideration and hope to find a way forward that benefits both students and the course objectives.\n-------------------\n\nAuthor: mahi.13\nDate: 2025-02-25T17:23:19.102Z\nContent:\nYes sir please look into this\n-------------------\n\nAuthor: 22f1000376\nDate: 2025-02-25T17:25:59.673Z\nContent:\n@Anand\n@Bharathi\nYes ma’am please pay attention to our concern.\n-------------------\n\nAuthor: Sakshi6479\nDate: 2025-02-25T17:27:50.727Z\nContent:\nYes sir, even it is tough for tech background students, just think about that how non-tech background students are handling the pressure for this course.

I hope I can do better on next mock.\nI completed my project but due to some issue I failed to submit it. That’s was my mistake, and I highly regret it. I lost 20 marks because of it despite working so hard.\n-------------------\n\nAuthor: 22f2001640\nDate: 2025-02-25T17:49:47.969Z\nContent:\nHi\n@s.anand\n@jkmadathil\n@Bharathi\n@carlton\n@Jivraj\n@Saransh_Saini\nCould you please look into the above issue?\nAdditionally, I’d like to highlight a concern regarding the current grading pattern ( JAN 2025 Term ) and overall course structuring:\nGrading Concerns\nFinal Course Score:\nT = 0.15GAA + 0.2 ROE1 + 0.2 P1 + 0.2 P2 + 0.25 F\n(The weightage of Projects + ROE accounts for 60% of the total score.)\nFrom the following Discourse post, it appears that the ROE exam is extremely difficult to the point of being considered “impossible” by students:\nWhat’s the actual purpose of impossible ROE exam?\n.\nGiven this, many students may directly lose 20 marks due to ROE, significantly impacting their overall scores.\nFurthermore, for Project 1 (\ndeadline: 16th Feb 2025\n), guidance was provided only in the week of the deadline. This was highly inconvenient, as the live session did not effectively address all student concerns. As a result, many students are at risk of losing a valuable 20 marks for Project 1.\nCourse Structuring & Scheduling Issues\nMany students pursuing this course are\ndual-degree students or working professionals\n, making it challenging to keep up with live sessions and deadlines.\nThe\nlast-minute guidance\nfor projects adds unnecessary pressure, especially for those juggling work or other academic commitments.\nThe\nstructuring and scheduling of sessions\nfeel inappropriate, with crucial guidance sessions being held too late, making it difficult to implement feedback or clarify doubts in time.\nRequest for Improvement\nTo ensure a smoother learning experience, I request:\nEarly guidance and detailed instructions for Project 2\n, well in advance of the deadline.\nMore structured and accessible support\n, considering the diverse student base, including working professionals.\nBetter management of exam difficulty levels\n, ensuring that assessments are fair and reflect actual learning rather than being unnecessarily tough.\nI hope these concerns can be taken into account, and necessary improvements can be made. Looking forward to your response.\n-------------------\n\nAuthor: 23f1002909\nDate: 2025-02-25T17:55:29.035Z\nContent:\nPlease look into it sir.\n-------------------\n\nAuthor: jkmadathil\nDate: 2025-02-25T18:34:40.325Z\nContent:\nThank you\n@A_LAKSHMI\nfor the detailed post. This is much appreciated. Thought of quickly stepping in before Anand or other members from the course team gives a more detailed response.\nLet me be Open and Blunt to all in saying that the\ngrading pattern will not be changed\n.  And the points below are some of quick things that came to my mind while reading the detailed listing of the challenges that have been put in the OP.\nTDS team have been tinkering with the course structure for the past 3 terms. You can check this\nDiscourse thread\nwhere students have unanimously said that this is not an easy subject. In fact the\nfirst page of the TDS course\nGA1 itself should have given everyone an indication of what lies ahead. Anand has explicitly written down the below words:\nThis course is quite hard\nHere’s students’ feedback:\nIt\nused\nto be an easy course until 2024.\n#\n#\n#\nNow it’s hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible.\n#\n#\n#\nPlan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses.\n#\n#\n#\nLLMs grade you – unpredictably.\n#\n#\nThe ROE is hard.\n#\nTake Graded assignment 1\nto check if you’re ready for this course.\nPlease drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It’ll be too tough for you now.\nTDS (or for that matter any course in this Degree program) is not supposed to be a single person effort. You should be realizing this even in your real life. A significant part of our learning process is social by nature. The only difference in this course is that we we explicitly encourage you to collaborate. If there is one main life lesson that we want you to learn out of this course then it is just this -\nSurviving tough situations require support all around us, and there is no shame in asking for help\nAgain to quote Anand:\nWe encourage learning by sharing\nYou\nCAN\ncopy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam).\nWhy should you copy?\nBecause in real life, there’s no time to re-invent the wheel. You’ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It’s important to learn how to do that well.\nTo learn well, understand\nwhat you’re copying. If you’re short of time, prioritize.\nTo learn better, teach\nwhat you’ve learnt.\nNow will be a good point to reflect on the optimization problem of Grades versus Learning. The larger question for each of you is to consider the short-term advantage of better grades versus the long term advantage of improving the fundamentals related to tools usage (not just for Data Science, but in every day life itself).\nOnce again Anand has a\nnice blog\nwhere [I think] he is trying to explain that neither do we know nor do students realize what is going to ultimately benefit us. This is a journey that all of us are taking together, and we hope such open interactions along with the course will make the learning (or teaching) experience enjoyable  and internally make us more humble.\nWhether you like it or not, life is becoming more complex day by day. And unless you figure out your optimization strategy, it is going to be a bumpy ride. And this is true even for the TDS course team members. Each of us are also juggling multiple responsibilities (some even doing 4 projects in this term) while ensuring that needed support can be provided to the learners. This is not lighten the issues that any of you have highlighted here, but just to point out that there is no flowery path for anyone here.\nThen the major question will be, why are all of doing this crazy business of learning tools in this way. The simplest answer is -\nTools are evolving day by day, and unless we realize that they are just “tools”, it is going to consume us an eternity to master them\nThe point of all the exercises and assessments, is for you to understand the fundamental aspects related to a tool and figure out your own strategies for getting a grip on them.\n@22f2001640\nManagement of time and difficulty levels are a shared responsibility. All of you have been sufficiently warned that the learning process wont be easy. In fact we have released all major content well in advance, so that learners can benefit from early access. And from our side, we also have realized the supporting learners wouldn’t be easy. But I see that the TDS course team members have been putting their heart and soul in this course (and support), and even in this week they have prepared 3 sets of ROEs in order to ensure that all of you get enough practice opportunity.\n-------------------\n\nAuthor: 23f1002698\nDate: 2025-02-25T21:19:52.440Z\nContent:\nRegarding your point of the short term benefits of grades vs the long term benefits of learning, I think I’m speaking for a lot of my peers that we’re not concerned about grades at this point, we just at least want to pass this course.\nI’m a standalone degree potential student and while I have learned a lot from the modules and do not condone dumbing it down, but at least after all this hard work I should be able to pass the course.\nWhile grades don’t matter in front of learning things but when passing the course itself is on the line then the learnings are overshadowed by the lack of marks. I want to invest myself in the ROE and the remaining project, but at this point I’m so frustrated about getting at least 40 that rather than a valuable learning experience, this course seems like a burden to me.\nI understand that the grading can’t be changed. All I hope and request that project 2 and end term turn out to be more approachable than project 1 and ROE so that after all this hard work, students like me at least get the privilege to pass.\n-------------------\n\nAuthor: Rrishit\nDate: 2025-02-26T09:28:00.959Z\nContent:\nNicely highlighted the concern of all students.\nTDS as a course has been really tedious this term.

But we will solve it in real time during the session. Thats why we are releasing it 1 hour before. We will freeze the form submissions during the solving session and then reopen it later.\nROE is not like other exams you have done so far in this entire diploma.\nSolving it leisurely will give you a false sense of your capabilities.\nThe truth is everyone can get full marks for ROE given enough time.\nThe problem is the lack of time.\nSo if you want to really check ROE readiness, fix the timer alarm for 45 mins and attempt it genuinely within the 45 mins. Only then will you know where you stand.\nAdditionally, each ROE is completely different from the next. If you manage to do good in one is ZERO guarantee that you will do good in the next.\nThats why do all 4 mock ROEs. ROE is not like any other exam. Other exams have the same types of questions. Not with ROE.\nThe real ROE will be also something that no one has seen before.\nBut we will help you be as ready as possible for it.\nKind regards\n-------------------\n\nAuthor: 23f2003413\nDate: 2025-02-25T10:38:35.694Z\nContent:\nhi\n@carlton\nhow are we supposed to give the mock ROE? where can I find the link? should i join gmeet while solving mock ROE or is it non-proctored? kindly clarify these doubts. thanks in advance!\n-------------------\n\nAuthor: carlton\nDate: 2025-02-25T10:58:33.712Z\nContent:\nYou will get an email at 7pm with the ROE dataset and the question form.\nI will also add the same in the student seek portal.\nMock ROEs are not proctored (its a mock!) and the actual ROE is not proctored either!\nThe gmeet is after the mock ROE where it will be solved live by the TDS team.\nKind regards\n-------------------\n\nAuthor: 23f1002382\nDate: 2025-02-25T13:05:15.578Z\nContent:\n3 questions:-\nwill the questions and dataset be available after time limit?\nwill the solutions be available for later reference with the questions?\nwill the live solving video lecture be recorded?\n-------------------\n\nAuthor: carlton\nDate: 2025-02-25T13:10:30.614Z\nContent:\n23f1002382:\nwill the questions and dataset be available after time limit?\nThey will be available after the live session has finished.\n23f1002382:\nwill the solutions be available for later reference with the questions?\nWe will provide an answer script for Mock ROE1\n23f1002382:\nwill the live solving video lecture be recorded?\nYes our live sessions will be recorded.\n-------------------\n\nAuthor: 23f1002382\nDate: 2025-02-25T13:14:38.360Z\nContent:\nthanks for the prompt response!

Thanks in advance.\n-------------------\n\nAuthor: carlton\nDate: 2025-02-24T09:16:21.851Z\nContent:\nProject 1 was based on Module 1 through 3.\nProject 2 will encompass Module 4 through 6 (and possibly 7) but not to the exclusion of the prior modules. These are not set in stone and still is in the design/validation phase.\nWe generally avoid calling it week 3 content etc. because all the content was released as modules at the beginning well before the term was started.\nThe GAs are released as we complete validations on them. Each term the course assignments are updated to stay current with industry expectations. So they are not recycled like subjects that are static like maths, statistics and programming which have syllabi that have not changed in 10 years or more.\nWe try to release GAs so that they match the cadence of the other subjects for the convenience of students wherever possible. But rarely do other subjects require constant revalidation for their GAs.\nHence we have situations, even in past terms, where GAs and Projects get moved to allow for robust validations of the answers. In spite of this some errors do slip through due to the aggressive time schedule in a trimester system as opposed to a semester system.\nHope that give you some insight into how TDS works.\nThanks for bearing with us. TDS is perpetually a WIP.\nKind regards\n-------------------"

Therefore its not possible to say what kind of questions will be there whether MCQ, MSQ or numerical or text etc.\nKind regards\n-------------------\n\nAuthor: carlton\nDate: 2025-02-24T07:52:35.373Z\nContent:\nThe ROEs are not GAs with short deadlines. A GA question usually tests one concept in isolation. ROEs typically require you to combine multiple concepts and use multiple tools in order to answer the question. (in a very short time).\nIf your goal is totally rely on the LLM to solve it for you… past experience shows us that ROEs complexity is usually difficult for an LLM to overcome without significant assistance from the “hooomann”\nSo practise with the concepts are going to be key without having to look up everything because looking up everything takes too much time. Collaboration with others is going be helpful. ROE is not proctored and is open internet. There is a reason for that. Its very hard.\nThere will be a dataset or multiple datasets. Sometimes you may have to combine datasets to answer questions. You will have to extract data from the dataset. You will have to transform/clean the data and you will have to gain some information from the data, is what typical ROEs test.\nKind regards\n-------------------\n\nAuthor: Yogesh1\nDate: 2025-02-24T08:39:53.315Z\nContent:\nIs there scope for collaboration in a 45 minute test?\n-------------------\n\nAuthor: carlton\nDate: 2025-02-24T08:59:27.794Z\nContent:\nDepends on the collaborators and how they split up the tasks. If its a team that knows their roles and a team leader that can designate tasks correctly then quite possibly. In practise though that rarely happens.\nAlso 45 mins is not a given, its a typical time we aim for. It can be shorter or longer depending on the nature of the questions in the ROE. Each one is unique. There have been ROEs as long as 2 hours and on the minimum side 30 mins.\n-------------------"

After several attempts my submission still generated differences from the supposed answers. I have tried all forms of re-punctuations but the error wont budge. I even compared the generated transcript with the actual audio several times. I BELIEVE MY ANSWER IS CORRECT. If not I wish to know what the correct answer is. Because compared to the video I have provided the exact and well punctuated transcription of the audio between 397.2 and 505.5 seconds.\nHere was my transcription - \" Determined to confront the mystery, Miranda followed the elusive figure. In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed.\nIn a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure’s voice emerged from the gloom, “You are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.”\nThe mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal—a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice.\nVictor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind.\nFrom within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund’s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations.\nMiranda’s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor’s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor’s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation \"\n-------------------\n\nAuthor: 23f2000573\nDate: 2025-02-22T08:30:32.330Z\nContent:\ni downloaded mp3, trimmed the video using ffmpeg  and used this\nConvert your MP3 to Text for Free Online\n, it worked\n-------------------"

I had two GATE papers on the 15th and an interview on the 16th, so I was extremely busy and couldn’t check my emails sooner.

Here are the highlights of the discussion:\nWe have moved Graded Assignment 5 (GA5) deadline which was due on 16th Feb to 21st Feb next Friday.\nAll the material to be able to do Project was available in Module 2 and Module 3, which was released on or before 10th of January (36 days ago)\nProject 1 was released 19th of January (27 days ago)\nWe had over 9 hours of sessions exclusively covering Project 1 (of which at least 8 hours are available on YouTube.) This excludes any week 2 and week 3 content which also would have given you the necessary skills to do Project 1. The sessions on YouTube give you a start to finish overview of how to approach it.\nAll of your concerns were duly noted and mentioned. Considering all the above, including the concerns mentioned by students:\nProject 1 deadline will NOT be changed.\nPlease make sure to carefully read the Deliverables and the Evaluation section and do them carefully and watch the intro to Week 3 - Session 1 to get an overview of what is absolutely essential and required. Watch Week 5 both sessions to see how we construct these requirements.\nKind regards\nTDS Team\n-------------------\n\nAuthor: ShahbaazSingh\nDate: 2025-02-14T06:50:15.092Z\nContent:\n-Yes sir this project 1 is very tough for even 1 question a whole day is used.\n@carlton\n@s.anand\nSir besides this project we have other subject graded assignments and MLP Project and MAD2 project.\nPlease sir it would be very beneficial for everyone, we have talked to other students also we are not able to even complete the 10 A tasks even with the evaluate.py rest aside Task B.\nPlease sir take this into consideration. We are trying very hard for this project even you can see students asking various questions in the discourse, we are struggling but still sir we are trying.\n-------------------\n\nAuthor: sha_512_av\nDate: 2025-02-14T10:38:25.088Z\nContent:\n@carlton\n@Jivraj\n@s.anand\nWe truly appreciate the efforts being put by the TDS team, but not to be rude here -\nWhy is Project 1 deadline is on Saturday and not on Sunday, as many of us are doing the course\nnot as a full-time\nstudent. (Some have Gate exam on Saturday also). So, extending the timeline to at least Sunday, 16th Feb would be truly appreciated.\nWeek 3 release date timeline is 24 Jan, we need adequate time to go through the weekly materials. All the contents are already released, so by the same logic upcoming Project 2 contents are also available but that doesn’t mean that we can complete the upcoming project within a week.\nProject help sessions came on 11th February(live) and 12th Feb on YouTube, just 4 days before the submission date, though I am not complaining about this and genuinely appreciating the team’s effort, but this does gives very less time for many of us here.\nThank you.\n-------------------\n\nAuthor: HarshJaiswal\nDate: 2025-02-14T11:38:25.143Z\nContent:\nsir…please extend the deadline…\n-------------------"

And datagen.py (or a similar named file which we will not tell you ahead of time and will be provided as the query parameter in task A1) will normally be called by evaluate.py\nInside the docker container, permission for the data folder is set by the Dockerfile\nwhich then allows your application to access the root folder inside your docker image and create the /data folder.\nSo the workflow is like this (for your internal testing only… please follow the Project page for deliverables and evaluation to submit project successfully):\nYou create your application server that serves 2 endpoints on localhost:8000\nYou create a docker image that runs this application server.\nYou run the docker image using podman as described in the project page.\nFor mimicking the testing conditions. You need two files:\nevaluate.py and datagen.py to be in the same folder where you are running these two scripts.\nRun evalute.py using uv.\nIf your docker image is correctly configured and your application is correctly configured, then all the tasks run by evaluate.py will correctly tell you if the application is producing the right result for each task.\nHope that gives clarity.\nKind regards\n-------------------"

At least tell us , what is llm and what is use of , everything is going to above of our head .\n-------------------\n\nAuthor: carlton\nDate: 2025-02-06T05:49:08.446Z\nContent:\nHi Hari,\nThe goal of the course was never to go deep into specific technologies, with perhaps the exception of LLMs as major tooling capability for data science. Due to the volume of the content in the first 3 weeks it was decided to at least get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded Assignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions were too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or not involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students. The quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and well attended.\nHave you watched this session in particular?\nIf thats insufficient for you last term we did a 2hr 48 min session on just introducing it\nfollowed by another 2 hour detailed explanation of the more advanced use cases\nBut of course does everyone want to watch 5.5 hours of sessions to understand it? That depends on the student.\nUltimately the best you can get out of sessions is by actually attending them because only then can we address gaps in understanding.\nKind regards\n-------------------"

I understand that in a professional setting, we often work on multiple projects simultaneously, and developing the habit of using virtual environments now can help reinforce this practice for future projects.\nAdditionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file? My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation. However, I have encountered instances where a specific version failed to install, requiring me to modify the requirements.txt file and remove the version constraint. In such cases, wouldn’t installing directly via pip be more practical?\nThat said, I also recognize that different projects may have unique dependency requirements. I’d appreciate your insights on best practices for managing dependencies efficiently.\n-------------------\n\nAuthor: carlton\nDate: 2025-01-31T06:50:45.102Z\nContent:\nYes, using a virtual environment is definitely considered best practice when working on Python projects. This approach helps avoid dependency conflicts between projects and ensures a consistent development environment. The main reasons why you should use virtual environments:\nIsolation\n– Each project has its own set of dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects.\nReproducibility\n– A virtual environment ensures that all contributors work with the same dependencies.\nPortability\n– You can share a project with others (or deploy it) without worrying about system-wide package versions interfering.\nInstalling with pip individually (pip install package-name)\n• Good for quick experimentation and testing.\n• Not ideal for long-term project management because dependencies might update and break compatibility over time.\nUsing requirements.txt\n• Best for\nreproducibility\nand\ncollaboration\nsince others can install the exact same dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.\n• Avoids issues where one developer uses an updated library that breaks compatibility with another developer’s setup.\nSpecifying Versions in requirements.txt\n• If you\ndon’t specify a version\n, pip install -r requirements.txt will install the latest available versions, which might introduce unexpected breaking changes.\n• If you\ndo specify a version (package==1.2.3)\n, you ensure consistency but may run into problems if that version becomes unavailable or has compatibility issues.\nHandling Version Conflicts\n• If a package version fails to install, try removing the strict version constraint and reinstall.\n• Instead of completely omitting version numbers, consider:\n• Using\ngreater than/less than constraints\n: package>=1.2,<2.0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes).\n• Running pip freeze > requirements.txt after confirming a stable environment.\nBest Practices Summary\nAlways use a virtual environment (e.g., venv or conda).\nUse a\nrequirements.txt\nfile for reproducibility.\nPin versions cautiously—avoid unnecessary strict versioning unless needed.\nPeriodically review and update dependencies to prevent using outdated or insecure packages.\nKind regards\n-------------------\n\nAuthor: 23f2003845\nDate: 2025-01-31T06:54:16.291Z\nContent:\nFor some projects where there are many dependencies, like an ML project or flask app, it’s better you mantain a virtual environment since the dependencies are interconnected with their versions.\nWhereas for some simple projects, with less dependencies, global installation is fine.\nFor project that is to be deployed, make sure you use the virtual environment, only then you can ensure what worked for you also works on the deployement\n24f2006531:\nAdditionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file?\nComing to your second question,\nThe first time you install a fresh dependency, use direct and latest version. But if you are cloning or thinking of sharing the repo or using someone’s project it’s better to use requirements.txt.\n24f2006531:\nMy understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation\nThe creation of requirements.txt ensures that the current installation version is listed.\nNever try to list requirements.txt. There is a command to do that,\npip3 freeze > requirements.txt\n. This does the hard work of listing the dependencies for you\n-------------------\n\nAuthor: 24f2006531\nDate: 2025-01-31T07:07:47.354Z\nContent:\nThank you sir for clarifying.\ncarlton:\n• Using\ngreater than/less than constraints\n: package>=1.2,<2.0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes).\nI wasn’t aware of greater than/less than constraint. This would definitely address the error I mentioned in my question.\n-------------------"

That means indirectly, one should complete many courses diploma in programming before doing TDS.\nIn such a case, how to drop the course Tools In Data Science(already registered) and get it replaced with another course to save time and without incurring financial losses(as dropping a course refunds only a certain percentage of fees amount paid for the course), and do it again later in terms. It’s completely IIT Madras’s fault since it was mentioned in the academics site that no prerequisites were required for the course while the reality turned out to be far from promises.

While I understand the necessity of these tutorials, they lack immediate exercises, which makes it difficult to retain the knowledge gained. Attempting to practice everything from these tutorials leaves insufficient time for other courses.\nAdditionally, while solving GAs helps reinforce learning, they don’t seem to cover all the concepts from the tutorials.\nI would want to know whether the learning from GAs is sufficient or if there’s a better way to balance this.\nPS - To address this at a management level, my suggestion would be to introduce AQs  or  mini exercises after each module. Alternatively, we could increase questions in GAs to cover more concepts, though the first approach might be more effective. Another improvement could be to reduce the diversity of content in a single week to make it more manageable.\n-------------------"

While I’m eager to take it on, I feel my current skill set might fall short of the project’s demands. I’m committed to pushing my boundaries and would greatly appreciate your guidance on topics or resources that could help me prepare more effectively during my free time.\nI want to ensure I can contribute something meaningful and engaging, even if the outcome isn’t perfect. If there are any recommended readings, practice problems, or areas of focus that you believe would provide a solid foundation for approaching this project, I would be very grateful for your suggestions.\nThank you for considering my request. I’m genuinely excited by the challenge and hope to make the most of this opportunity to learn and grow under your guidance.\n@s.anand\nChatGPT can make mistakes.

Now you can get this answer by using parsing tools and few lines of codes and after getting the results you can write that answer back in the portal .\nSame goes for assignments , they will be more like minor project works.\n-------------------"
